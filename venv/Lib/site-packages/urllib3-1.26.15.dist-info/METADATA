urllib3 is a powerful, *user-friendly* HTTP client for Python. Much of the
Python ecosystem already uses urllib3 and you should too.
urllib3 brings many critical features that are missing from the Python
standard libraries:

- Thread safety.
- Connection pooling.
- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.
- File uploads with multipart encoding.
- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.
- Support for gzip, deflate, and brotli encoding.
- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.
- 100% test coverage.

urllib3 is powerful and easy to use:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import urllib3
    >>> http = urllib3.PoolManager()
    >>> r = http.request('GET', 'http://httpbin.org/robots.txt')
    >>> r.status
    200
    >>> r.data
    'User-agent: *\nDisallow: /deny\n'

Changes
=======

1.26.15 (2023-03-10)
--------------------

* Fix socket timeout value when ``HTTPConnection`` is reused (`#2645 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2645>`__)
* Remove "!" character from the unreserved characters in IPv6 Zone ID parsing
  (`#2899 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2899>`__)
* Fix IDNA handling of '\x80' byte (`#2901 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2901>`__)

1.26.14 (2023-01-11)
--------------------

* Fixed parsing of port 0 (zero) returning None, instead of 0. (`#2850 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2850>`__)
* Removed deprecated getheaders() calls in contrib module.

1.26.13 (2022-11-23)
--------------------

* Deprecated the ``HTTPResponse.getheaders()`` and ``HTTPResponse.getheader()`` methods.
* Fixed an issue where parsing a URL with leading zeroes in the port would be rejected
  even when the port number after removing the zeroes was valid.
* Fixed a deprecation warning when using cryptography v39.0.0.
* Removed the ``<4`` in the ``Requires-Python`` packaging metadata field.


1.26.12 (2022-08-22)
--------------------

* Deprecated the `urllib3[secure]` extra and the `urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl` module.
  Both will be removed in v2.x. See this `GitHub issue <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2680>`_
  for justification and info on how to migrate.


1.26.11 (2022-07-25)
--------------------

* Fixed an issue where reading more than 2 GiB in a call to ``HTTPResponse.read`` would
  raise an ``OverflowError`` on Python 3.9 and earlier.


1.26.10 (2022-07-07)
--------------------

* Removed support for Python 3.5
* Fixed an issue where a ``ProxyError`` recommending configuring the proxy as HTTP
  instead of HTTPS could appear even when an HTTPS proxy wasn't configured.


1.26.9 (2022-03-16)
-------------------

* Changed ``urllib3[brotli]`` extra to favor installing Brotli libraries that are still
  receiving updates like ``brotli`` and ``brotlicffi`` instead of ``brotlipy``.
  This change does not impact behavior of urllib3, only which dependencies are installed.
* Fixed a socket leaking when ``HTTPSConnection.connect()`` raises an exception.
* Fixed ``server_hostname`` being forwarded from ``PoolManager`` to ``HTTPConnectionPool``
  when requesting an HTTP URL. Should only be forwarded when requesting an HTTPS URL.


1.26.8 (2022-01-07)
-------------------

* Added extra message to ``urllib3.exceptions.ProxyError`` when urllib3 detects that
  a proxy is configured to use HTTPS but the proxy itself appears to only use HTTP.
* Added a mention of the size of the connection pool when discarding a connection due to the pool being full.
* Added explicit support for Python 3.11.
* Deprecated the ``Retry.MAX_BACKOFF`` class property in favor of ``Retry.DEFAULT_MAX_BACKOFF``
  to better match the rest of the default parameter names. ``Retry.MAX_BACKOFF`` is removed in v2.0.
* Changed location of the vendored ``ssl.match_hostname`` function from ``urllib3.packages.ssl_match_hostname``
  to ``urllib3.util.ssl_match_hostname`` to ensure Python 3.10+ compatibility after being repackaged
  by downstream distributors.
* Fixed absolute imports, all imports are now relative.


1.26.7 (2021-09-22)
-------------------

* Fixed a bug with HTTPS hostname verification involving IP addresses and lack
  of SNI. (Issue #2400)
* Fixed a bug where IPv6 braces weren't stripped during certificate hostname
  matching. (Issue #2240)


1.26.6 (2021-06-25)
-------------------

* Deprecated the ``urllib3.contrib.ntlmpool`` module. urllib3 is not able to support
  it properly due to `reasons listed in this issue <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2282>`_.
  If you are a user of this module please leave a comment.
* Changed ``HTTPConnection.request_chunked()`` to not erroneously emit multiple
  ``Transfer-Encoding`` headers in the case that one is already specified.
* Fixed typo in deprecation message to recommend ``Retry.DEFAULT_ALLOWED_METHODS``.


1.26.5 (2021-05-26)
-------------------

* Fixed deprecation warnings emitted in Python 3.10.
* Updated vendored ``six`` library to 1.16.0.
* Improved performance of URL parser when splitting
  the authority component.


1.26.4 (2021-03-15)
-------------------

* Changed behavior of the default ``SSLContext`` when connecting to HTTPS proxy
  during HTTPS requests. The default ``SSLContext`` now sets ``check_hostname=True``.


1.26.3 (2021-01-26)
-------------------

* Fixed bytes and string comparison issue with headers (Pull #2141)

* Changed ``ProxySchemeUnknown`` error message to be
  more actionable if the user supplies a proxy URL without
  a scheme. (Pull #2107)


1.26.2 (2020-11-12)
-------------------

* Fixed an issue where ``wrap_socket`` and ``CERT_REQUIRED`` wouldn't
  be imported properly on Python 2.7.8 and earlier (Pull #2052)


1.26.1 (2020-11-11)
-------------------

* Fixed an issue where two ``User-Agent`` headers would be sent if a
  ``User-Agent`` header key is passed as ``bytes`` (Pull #2047)


1.26.0 (2020-11-10)
-------------------

* **NOTE: urllib3 v2.0 will drop support for Python 2**.
  `Read more in the v2.0 Roadmap <https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2-roadmap.html>`_.

* Added support for HTTPS proxies contacting HTTPS servers (Pull #1923, Pull #1806)

* Deprecated negotiating TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 by default. Users that
  still wish to use TLS earlier than 1.2 without a deprecation warning
  should opt-in explicitly by setting ``ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_1`` (Pull #2002)
  **Starting in urllib3 v2.0: Connections that receive a ``DeprecationWarning`` will fail**

* Deprecated ``Retry`` options ``Retry.DEFAULT_METHOD_WHITELIST``, ``Retry.DEFAULT_REDIRECT_HEADERS_BLACKLIST``
  and ``Retry(method_whitelist=...)`` in favor of ``Retry.DEFAULT_ALLOWED_METHODS``,
  ``Retry.DEFAULT_REMOVE_HEADERS_ON_REDIRECT``, and ``Retry(allowed_methods=...)``
  (Pull #2000) **Starting in urllib3 v2.0: Deprecated options will be removed**

* Added default ``User-Agent`` header to every request (Pull #1750)

* Added ``urllib3.util.SKIP_HEADER`` for skipping ``User-Agent``, ``Accept-Encoding``, 
  and ``Host`` headers from being automatically emitted with requests (Pull #2018)

* Collapse ``transfer-encoding: chunked`` request data and framing into
  the same ``socket.send()`` call (Pull #1906)

* Send ``http/1.1`` ALPN identifier with every TLS handshake by default (Pull #1894)

* Properly terminate SecureTransport connections when CA verification fails (Pull #1977)

* Don't emit an ``SNIMissingWarning`` when passing ``server_hostname=None``
  to SecureTransport (Pull #1903)

* Disabled requesting TLSv1.2 session tickets as they weren't being used by urllib3 (Pull #1970)

* Suppress ``BrokenPipeError`` when writing request body after the server
  has closed the socket (Pull #1524)

* Wrap ``ssl.SSLError`` that can be raised from reading a socket (e.g. "bad MAC")
  into an ``urllib3.exceptions.SSLError`` (Pull #1939)


1.25.11 (2020-10-19)
--------------------

* Fix retry backoff time parsed from ``Retry-After`` header when given
  in the HTTP date format. The HTTP date was parsed as the local timezone
  rather than accounting for the timezone in the HTTP date (typically
  UTC) (Pull #1932, Pull #1935, Pull #1938, Pull #1949)

* Fix issue where an error would be raised when the ``SSLKEYLOGFILE``
  environment variable was set to the empty string. Now ``SSLContext.keylog_file``
  is not set in this situation (Pull #2016)


1.25.10 (2020-07-22)
--------------------

* Added support for ``SSLKEYLOGFILE`` environment variable for
  logging TLS session keys with use with programs like
  Wireshark for decrypting captured web traffic (Pull #1867)

* Fixed loading of SecureTransport libraries on macOS Big Sur
  due to the new dynamic linker cache (Pull #1905)

* Collapse chunked request bodies data and framing into one
  call to ``send()`` to reduce the number of TCP packets by 2-4x (Pull #1906)

* Don't insert ``None`` into ``ConnectionPool`` if the pool
  was empty when requesting a connection (Pull #1866)

* Avoid ``hasattr`` call in ``BrotliDecoder.decompress()`` (Pull #1858)


1.25.9 (2020-04-16)
-------------------

* Added ``InvalidProxyConfigurationWarning`` which is raised when
  erroneously specifying an HTTPS proxy URL. urllib3 doesn't currently
  support connecting to HTTPS proxies but will soon be able to
  and we would like users to migrate properly without much breakage.

  See `this GitHub issue <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1850>`_
  for more information on how to fix your proxy config. (Pull #1851)

* Drain connection after ``PoolManager`` redirect (Pull #1817)

* Ensure ``load_verify_locations`` raises ``SSLError`` for all backends (Pull #1812)

* Rename ``VerifiedHTTPSConnection`` to ``HTTPSConnection`` (Pull #1805)

* Allow the CA certificate data to be passed as a string (Pull #1804)

* Raise ``ValueError`` if method contains control characters (Pull #1800)

* Add ``__repr__`` to ``Timeout`` (Pull #1795)

* Fix issue where URL fragment was sent within the request target. (Pull #1732)

* Fix issue where an empty query section in a URL would fail to parse. (Pull #1732)

* Remove TLS 1.3 support in SecureTransport due to Apple removing support (Pull #1703)


1.25.6 (2019-09-24)
-------------------

* Fix issue where tilde (``~``) characters were incorrectly
  percent-encoded in the path. (Pull #1692)


1.25.5 (2019-09-19)
-------------------

* Add mitigation for BPO-37428 affecting Python <3.7.4 and OpenSSL 1.1.1+ which
  caused certificate verification to be enabled when using ``cert_reqs=CERT_NONE``.
  (Issue #1682)


1.25.4 (2019-09-19)
-------------------

* Propagate Retry-After header settings to subsequent retries. (Pull #1607)

* Fix edge case where Retry-After header was still respected even when
  explicitly opted out of. (Pull #1607)

* Remove dependency on ``rfc3986`` for URL parsing.

* Fix issue where URLs containing invalid characters within ``Url.auth`` would
  raise an exception instead of percent-encoding those characters.

* Add support for ``HTTPResponse.auto_close = False`` which makes HTTP responses
  work well with BufferedReaders and other ``io`` module features. (Pull #1652)

* Percent-encode invalid characters in URL for ``HTTPConnectionPool.request()`` (Pull #1673)


1.25.3 (2019-05-23)

  when ``ca_certs``, ``ca_cert_dir``, and ``ssl_context`` are
  unspecified. (Pull #1608, Issue #1603)

* Upgrade bundled rfc3986 to v1.3.2. (Pull #1609, Issue #1605)


1.25.2 (2019-04-28)
-------------------

* Change ``is_ipaddress`` to not detect IPvFuture addresses. (Pull #1583)

  path, query, and target components. (Pull #1586)


1.25.1 (2019-04-24)
-------------------

* Add support for Google's ``Brotli`` package. (Pull #1572, Pull #1579)

1.25 (2019-04-22)
-----------------

* Require and validate certificates by default when using HTTPS (Pull #1507)

* Upgraded ``urllib3.utils.parse_url()`` to be RFC 3986 compliant. (Pull #1487)

* Switched the default multipart header encoder from RFC 2231 to HTML 5 working draft. (Issue #303, Pull #1492)

* Fixed issue where OpenSSL would block if an encrypted client private key was
  given and no password was given. Instead an ``SSLError`` is raised. (Pull #1489)

* Move urllib3 to src/urllib3 (Pull #1409)


1.23 (2018-06-04)
-----------------

* Allow providing a list of headers to strip from requests when redirecting

1.21.1 (2017-05-02)
-------------------

* Fixed SecureTransport issue that would cause long delays in response body
  delivery. (Pull #1154)

* Fixed regression in 1.21 that threw exceptions when users passed the
  ``socket_options`` flag to the ``PoolManager``.  (Issue #1165)

* Fixed regression in 1.21 that threw exceptions when users passed the
  ``assert_hostname`` or ``assert_fingerprint`` flag to the ``PoolManager``.
  (Pull #1157)


1.21 (2017-04-25)
-----------------

* Improved performance of certain selector system calls on Python 3.5 and
  later. (Pull #1095)

* Resolved issue where the PyOpenSSL backend would not wrap SysCallError
  exceptions appropriately when sending data. (Pull #1125)

* Selectors now detects a monkey-patched select module after import for modules
  that patch the select module like eventlet, greenlet. (Pull #1128)

* Reduced memory consumption when streaming zlib-compressed responses
  (as opposed to raw deflate streams). (Pull #1129)

* Connection pools now use the entire request context when constructing the
  pool key. (Pull #1016)

* ``PoolManager.connection_from_*`` methods now accept a new keyword argument,
  ``pool_kwargs``, which are merged with the existing ``connection_pool_kw``.
  (Pull #1016)

* Add retry counter for ``status_forcelist``. (Issue #1147)

* Added ``contrib`` module for using SecureTransport on macOS:
  ``urllib3.contrib.securetransport``.  (Pull #1122)

* urllib3 now only normalizes the case of ``http://`` and ``https://`` schemes:
  for schemes it does not recognise, it assumes they are case-sensitive and
  leaves them unchanged.
  (Issue #1080)


1.20 (2017-01-19)
-----------------

* Added support for waiting for I/O using selectors other than select,
  improving urllib3's behaviour with large numbers of concurrent connections.
  (Pull #1001)

* Updated the date for the system clock check. (Issue #1005)

* ConnectionPools now correctly consider hostnames to be case-insensitive.
  (Issue #1032)

  (Pull #1061)

* Prevent retries from occurring on read timeouts for which the request method
  was not in the method whitelist. (Issue #1059)

* Changed the PyOpenSSL contrib module to lazily load idna to avoid
  unnecessarily bloating the memory of programs that don't need it. (Pull
  #1076)

* Add support for IPv6 literals with zone identifiers. (Pull #1013)

* Added support for socks5h:// and socks4a:// schemes when working with SOCKS
  proxies, and controlled remote DNS appropriately. (Issue #1035)


1.19.1 (2016-11-16)
-------------------

* Fixed AppEngine import that didn't function on Python 3.5. (Pull #1025)


1.19 (2016-11-03)
-----------------

* urllib3 now respects Retry-After headers on 413, 429, and 503 responses when
  using the default retry logic. (Pull #955)

* Remove markers from setup.py to assist ancient setuptools versions. (Issue
  #986)

* Disallow superscripts and other integerish things in URL ports. (Issue #989)

* Allow urllib3's HTTPResponse.stream() method to continue to work with
  non-httplib underlying FPs. (Pull #990)

* Empty filenames in multipart headers are now emitted as such, rather than
  being suppressed. (Issue #1015)

* Prefer user-supplied Host headers on chunked uploads. (Issue #1009)


1.18.1 (2016-10-27)
-------------------

* CVE-2016-9015. Users who are using urllib3 version 1.17 or 1.18 along with
  PyOpenSSL injection and OpenSSL 1.1.0 *must* upgrade to this version. This
  release fixes a vulnerability whereby urllib3 in the above configuration
  would silently fail to validate TLS certificates due to erroneously setting
  invalid flags in OpenSSL's ``SSL_CTX_set_verify`` function. These erroneous
  flags do not cause a problem in OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0, which
  interprets the presence of any flag as requesting certificate validation.

  There is no PR for this patch, as it was prepared for simultaneous disclosure
  and release. The master branch received the same fix in Pull #1010.

  (Issue #309)

* Fixed ``urllib3.poolmanager.ProxyManager`` not retrying on connect errors.
  (Issue #310)

* Disable Nagle's Algorithm on the socket for non-proxies. A subset of requests
  will send the entire HTTP request ~200 milliseconds faster; however, some of
  the resulting TCP packets will be smaller. (Issue #254)

* Increased maximum number of SubjectAltNames in ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl``
  from the default 64 to 1024 in a single certificate. (Issue #318)

* Headers are now passed and stored as a custom
  ``urllib3.collections_.HTTPHeaderDict`` object rather than a plain ``dict``.
  (Issue #329, #333)

* Headers no longer lose their case on Python 3. (Issue #236)

* ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl`` now uses the operating system's default CA
  certificates on inject. (Issue #332)

  file-like functionality. (Issue #187)

* Passing ``assert_hostname=False`` when creating a HTTPSConnectionPool will
  skip hostname verification for SSL connections. (Issue #194)

  generator wrapped around ``.read(...)``. (Issue #198)

* IPv6 url parsing enforces brackets around the hostname. (Issue #199)

* Fixed thread race condition in
  ``urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager.connection_from_host(...)`` (Issue #204)

* ``ProxyManager`` automatically adds ``Host: ...`` header if not given.

* Improved SSL-related code. ``cert_req`` now optionally takes a string like
  "REQUIRED" or "NONE". Same with ``ssl_version`` takes strings like "SSLv23"
  The string values reflect the suffix of the respective constant variable.
  (Issue #130)

* Vendored ``socksipy`` now based on Anorov's fork which handles unexpectedly
  closed proxy connections and larger read buffers. (Issue #135)

* Ensure the connection is closed if no data is received, fixes connection leak
  on some platforms. (Issue #133)

* Added SNI support for SSL/TLS connections on Py32+. (Issue #89)

* Tests fixed to be compatible with Py26 again. (Issue #125)

  Section 3.5. (Issue #110)

* "Connection Refused" SocketErrors will get retried rather than raised.
  (Issue #92)

* Updated vendored ``six``, no longer overrides the global ``six`` module
  namespace. (Issue #113)

* ``urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError`` contains a ``reason`` property holding
  the exception that prompted the final retry. If ``reason is None`` then it
  was due to a redirect. (Issue #92, #114)

* Fixed ``PoolManager.urlopen()`` from not redirecting more than once.
  (Issue #149)

* Don't assume ``Content-Type: text/plain`` for multi-part encoding parameters
  that are not files. (Issue #111)

  ``urllib3.util.parse_url(url)``.

* Built-in redirect will switch method to 'GET' if status code is 303.
  (Issue #11)

* ``urllib3.PoolManager`` strips the scheme and host before sending the request
  uri. (Issue #8)

* New ``urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError`` exception for when automatic decoding,
  based on the Content-Type header, fails.

* Fixed bug with pool depletion and leaking connections (Issue #76). Added
  explicit connection closing on pool eviction. Added
  ``urllib3.PoolManager.clear()``.

1.2.1 (2012-02-05)
------------------

* Fixed another bug related to when ``ssl`` module is not available. (Issue #41)

* Location parsing errors now raise ``urllib3.exceptions.LocationParseError``
  which inherits from ``ValueError``.


1.2 (2012-01-29)
----------------

* Added Python 3 support (tested on 3.2.2)

* Dropped Python 2.5 support (tested on 2.6.7, 2.7.2)

* Use ``select.poll`` instead of ``select.select`` for platforms that support
  it.

* Use ``Queue.LifoQueue`` instead of ``Queue.Queue`` for more aggressive
  connection reusing. Configurable by overriding ``ConnectionPool.QueueCls``.

* Fixed ``ImportError`` during install when ``ssl`` module is not available.
  (Issue #41)

* Fixed ``PoolManager`` redirects between schemes (such as HTTP -> HTTPS) not
  completing properly. (Issue #28, uncovered by Issue #10 in v1.1)

* Ported ``dummyserver`` to use ``tornado`` instead of ``webob`` +
  ``eventlet``. Removed extraneous unsupported dummyserver testing backends.
  Added socket-level tests.

  #27)

* Fixed timeout-related bugs. (Issues #17, #23)


1.0.2 (2011-11-04)
------------------

* Fixed typo in ``VerifiedHTTPSConnection`` which would only present as a bug if
  you're using the object manually. (Thanks pyos)

* Made RecentlyUsedContainer (and consequently PoolManager) more thread-safe by
  wrapping the access log in a mutex. (Thanks @christer)

* Made RecentlyUsedContainer more dict-like (corrected ``__delitem__`` and
  ``__getitem__`` behaviour), with tests. Shouldn't affect core urllib3 code.


1.0.1 (2011-10-10)
------------------

* Fixed a bug where the same connection would get returned into the pool twice,
  causing extraneous "HttpConnectionPool is full" log warnings.


1.0 (2011-10-08)
----------------

* Added ``PoolManager`` with LRU expiration of connections (tested and
  documented).
* Added ``ProxyManager`` (needs tests, docs, and confirmation that it works
  with HTTPS proxies).
* Added optional partial-read support for responses when
  ``preload_content=False``. You can now make requests and just read the headers
  without loading the content.
* Made response decoding optional (default on, same as before).
* Added optional explicit boundary string for ``encode_multipart_formdata``.
* Convenience request methods are now inherited from ``RequestMethods``. Old
  helpers like ``get_url`` and ``post_url`` should be abandoned in favour of
  the new ``request(method, url, ...)``.
* Refactored code to be even more decoupled, reusable, and extendable.
* License header added to ``.py`` files.
* Embiggened the documentation: Lots of Sphinx-friendly docstrings in the code
  and docs in ``docs/`` and on https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/.
* Embettered all the things!
* Started writing this file.
