You specify the new billing account by setting the `billing_account_name` in the `ProjectBillingInfo` resource to the resource name of a billing account. Associating a project with an open billing account enables billing on the project and allows charges for resource usage. If the project already had a billing account, this method changes the billing account used for resource usage charges. *Note:* Incurred charges that have not yet been reported in the transaction history of the Google Cloud Console might be billed to the new billing account, even if the charge occurred before the new billing account was assigned to the project. The current authenticated user must have ownership privileges for both the [project](https://cloud.google.com/docs/permissions-overview#h.bgs0oxofvnoo ) and the [billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-access). You can disable billing on the project by setting the `billing_account_name` field to empty. This action disassociates the current billing account from the project. Any billable activity of your in-use services will stop, and your application could stop functioning as expected. Any unbilled charges to date will be billed to the previously associated account. The current authenticated user must be either an owner of the project or an owner of the billing account for the project. Note that associating a project with a *closed* billing account will have much the same effect as disabling billing on the project: any paid resources used by the project will be shut down. Thus, unless you wish to disable billing, you should always call this method with the name of an *open* billing account.",

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).",
