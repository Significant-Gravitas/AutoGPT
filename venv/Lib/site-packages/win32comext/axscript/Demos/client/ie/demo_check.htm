<p>The Python ActiveX Scripting Engine is not currently registered.<p>

<p>Due to a <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/PrivacyProblem.html">privacy
concern</a> discovered in the engine, the use of Python inside IE has been disabled.</p>

Before any of the supplied demos will work, the engine must be successfully registered.
