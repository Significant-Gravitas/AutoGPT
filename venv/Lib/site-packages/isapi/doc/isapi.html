<h3>Introduction</h3>
This documents Python support for hosting ISAPI exensions and filters inside
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS). It assumes a basic understanding 
of the ISAPI filter and extension mechanism.
<p>
In summary, to implement a filter or extension, you provide a Python module
which defines a Filter and/or Extension class.  Once your class has been
loaded, IIS/ISAPI will, via an extension DLL, call methods on your class.
<p>
A filter and a class instance need only provide 3 methods - for filters they
are called <code>GetFilterVersion</code>, <code>HttpFilterProc</code> and
<code>TerminateFilter</code>.  For extensions they
are named <code>GetExtensionVersion</code>, <code>HttpExtensionProc</code> and
<code>TerminateExtension</code>.  If you are familiar with writing ISAPI 
extensions in C/C++, these names and their purpose will be familiar.
<p>
Most of the work is done in the <code>HttpFilterProc</code> and 
<code>HttpExtensionProc</code> methods.  These both take a single
parameter - an <a href="/HTTP_FILTER_CONTEXT.html">HTTP_FILTER_CONTEXT</a> and 
<a href="/EXTENSION_CONTROL_BLOCK.html">EXTENSION_CONTROL_BLOCK</a>
object respectively.
<p>
In addition to these components, there is an 'isapi' package, containing
support facilities (base-classes, exceptions, etc) which can be leveraged
by the extension.

<h4>Base classes</h4>
There are a number of base classes provided to make writing extensions a little
simpler.  Of particular note is <code>isapi.threaded_extension.ThreadPoolExtension</code>.
This implements a thread-pool and informs IIS that the request is progressing 
in the background.  Your sub-class need only provide a <code>Dispatch</code> 
method, which is called on one of the worker threads rather than the thread
that the request came in on.
<p>
There is base-class for a filter in <code>isapi.simple</code>, but there is no
equivilent threaded filter - filters work under a different model, where
background processing is not possible.
<h4>Samples</h4>
Please see the <code>isapi/samples</code> directory for some sample filters 
and extensions.

<H3>Implementation</H3>
A Python ISAPI filter extension consists of 2 main components:
<UL>
<LI>A DLL used by ISAPI to interface with Python.</LI>
<LI>A Python script used by that DLL to implement the filter or extension 
functionality</LI>
</UL>

<h4>Extension DLL</h4>
The DLL is usually managed automatically by the isapi.install module.  As the
Python script for the extension is installed, a generic DLL provided with 
the isapi package is installed next to the script, and IIS configured to
use this DLL.
<p>
The name of the DLL always has the same base name as the Python script, but
with a leading underscore (_), and an extension of .dll.  For example, the 
sample "redirector.py" will, when installed, have "_redirector.dll" created
in the same directory.
<p/>
The Python script may provide 2 entry points - methods named __FilterFactory__ 
and __ExtensionFactory__, both taking no arguments and returning a filter or
extension object.

<h3>Using py2exe and the isapi package</h3>
You can instruct py2exe to create a 'frozen' Python ISAPI filter/extension.
In this case, py2exe will create a package with everything you need in one
directory, and the Python source file embedded in the .zip file.
<p>
In general, you will want to build a seperate installation executable along 
with the ISAPI extension.  This executable will be built from the same script.
See the ISAPI sample in the py2exe distribution.
