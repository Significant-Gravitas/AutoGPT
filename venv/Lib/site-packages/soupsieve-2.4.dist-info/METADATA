# Soup Sieve

## Overview

Soup Sieve is a CSS selector library designed to be used with [Beautiful Soup 4][bs4]. It aims to provide selecting,
matching, and filtering using modern CSS selectors. Soup Sieve currently provides selectors from the CSS level 1
specifications up through the latest CSS level 4 drafts and beyond (though some are not yet implemented).

Soup Sieve was written with the intent to replace Beautiful Soup's builtin select feature, and as of Beautiful Soup
version 4.7.0, it now is :confetti_ball:. Soup Sieve can also be imported in order to use its API directly for
more controlled, specialized parsing.

Soup Sieve has implemented most of the CSS selectors up through the latest CSS draft specifications, though there are a
number that don't make sense in a non-browser environment. Selectors that cannot provide meaningful functionality simply
do not match anything. Some of the supported selectors are:

- `.classes`
- `#ids`
- `[attributes=value]`
- `parent child`
- `parent > child`
- `sibling ~ sibling`
- `sibling + sibling`
- `:not(element.class, element2.class)`
- `:is(element.class, element2.class)`
- `parent:has(> child)`
- and [many more](https://facelessuser.github.io/soupsieve/selectors/)


## Installation

You must have Beautiful Soup already installed:

```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

In most cases, assuming you've installed version 4.7.0, that should be all you need to do, but if you've installed via
some alternative method, and Soup Sieve is not automatically installed, you can install it directly:

```
pip install soupsieve
```

If you want to manually install it from source, first ensure that [`build`](https://pypi.org/project/build/) is
installed:

```
pip install build
```

Then navigate to the root of the project and build the wheel and install (replacing `<ver>` with the current version):

```
python -m build -w
pip install dist/soupsive-<ver>-py3-none-any.whl
```
