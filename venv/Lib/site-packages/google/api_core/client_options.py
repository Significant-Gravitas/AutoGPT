"""Client options class.

Client options provide a consistent interface for user options to be defined
across clients.

You can pass a client options object to a client.

.. code-block:: python

    from google.api_core.client_options import ClientOptions
    from google.cloud.vision_v1 import ImageAnnotatorClient

    def get_client_cert():
        # code to load client certificate and private key.
        return client_cert_bytes, client_private_key_bytes

    options = ClientOptions(api_endpoint="foo.googleapis.com",
        client_cert_source=get_client_cert)

    client = ImageAnnotatorClient(client_options=options)

You can also pass a mapping object.

.. code-block:: python

    from google.cloud.vision_v1 import ImageAnnotatorClient

    client = ImageAnnotatorClient(
        client_options={
            "api_endpoint": "foo.googleapis.com",
            "client_cert_source" : get_client_cert
        })

class ClientOptions(object):

    Args:
        api_endpoint (Optional[str]): The desired API endpoint, e.g.,
            compute.googleapis.com
        client_cert_source (Optional[Callable[[], (bytes, bytes)]]): A callback
            which returns client certificate bytes and private key bytes both in
            PEM format. ``client_cert_source`` and ``client_encrypted_cert_source``
            are mutually exclusive.
        client_encrypted_cert_source (Optional[Callable[[], (str, str, bytes)]]):
            A callback which returns client certificate file path, encrypted
            private key file path, and the passphrase bytes.``client_cert_source``
            and ``client_encrypted_cert_source`` are mutually exclusive.

            quota belongs to.
        credentials_file (Optional[str]): A path to a file storing credentials.
            ``credentials_file` and ``api_key`` are mutually exclusive.
        scopes (Optional[Sequence[str]]): OAuth access token override scopes.
        api_key (Optional[str]): Google API key. ``credentials_file`` and
            ``api_key`` are mutually exclusive.
        api_audience (Optional[str]): The intended audience for the API calls
            to the service that will be set when using certain 3rd party
            authentication flows. Audience is typically a resource identifier.
            If not set, the service endpoint value will be used as a default.
            An example of a valid ``api_audience`` is: "https://language.googleapis.com".
