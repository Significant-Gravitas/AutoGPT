        client_library_version (Optional[str]): The version of the client
            library, generally used if the client library was not generated
            by gapic or if additional functionality was built on top of
            a gapic client library.
        user_agent (Optional[str]): Prefix to the user agent header. This is
            used to supply information such as application name or partner tool.
