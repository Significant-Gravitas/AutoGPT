// assigned the listed numeric values. The effect of using numeric values other
// than those listed is undefined.

// filter expression will match log entries with severities `INFO`, `NOTICE`,
// and `WARNING`:
//
//     severity > DEBUG AND severity <= WARNING
//
// If you are writing log entries, you should map other severity encodings to
// one of these standard levels. For example, you might map all of Java's FINE,
// FINER, and FINEST levels to `LogSeverity.DEBUG`. You can preserve the
// original severity level in the log entry payload if you wish.
