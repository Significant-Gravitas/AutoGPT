Welcome to the AutoGPT Docs.

The AutoGPT project has been divided into four distinct sections: [Agents](#welcome-to-the-heart-of-autogpt), [Benchmarks](#autogpt-benchmarks), [Forge](#autogpt-forge), and [Frontend](#frontend)

## [Welcome to the heart of AutoGPT](AutoGPT/setup.md)

Welcome to the heart of AutoGPT, the project that kicked it all off: a semi-autonomous agent powered by LLMs to execute any task for you*.

We continue to develop this project with the goal of providing access to AI assistance to the masses, and building the future transparently and together.

- 💡 **Explore** - See what AI can do and be inspired by a glimpse of the future.

- 🚀 **Build with us** - We welcome any input, whether it's code or ideas for new features or improvements! Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/autogpt) and find out how you can join in on the action.

<small>* it isn't quite there yet, but that is the ultimate goal that we are still pursuing</small>
