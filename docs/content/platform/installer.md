# AutoGPT Platform Installer

The AutoGPT Platform provides easy-to-use installers to help you quickly set up the platform on your system. This page covers how to use the installer scripts for both Linux/macOS and Windows.

## What the Installer Does

The installer scripts will:

1. Check for required prerequisites (Git, Docker, npm)
2. Clone the AutoGPT repository
3. Set up the backend services using Docker
4. Set up the frontend application
5. Start both the backend and frontend services

## Prerequisites

Before running the installer, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Git**: For cloning the repository
- **Docker**: For running the backend services
- **Node.js and npm**: For the frontend application
