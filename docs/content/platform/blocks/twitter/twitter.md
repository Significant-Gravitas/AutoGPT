## Extra notes

- Use combinations of expansions and fields to build precise queries. For instance:
  - To fetch a Tweet with media details, include `expansions=Media_Keys` and relevant `media_fields`.
  - For user data in Tweets, add `expansions=Author_User_ID` and appropriate `user_fields`.

- Data returned under `includes` helps cross-reference expanded data objects with their parent entities using IDs.
