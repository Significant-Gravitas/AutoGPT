# Contributing to AutoGPT Agent Server: Creating and Testing Blocks

This guide will walk you through the process of creating and testing a new block for the AutoGPT Agent Server, using the WikipediaSummaryBlock as an example.

## Understanding Blocks and Testing

Blocks are reusable components that can be connected to form a graph representing an agent's behavior. Each block has inputs, outputs, and a specific function. Proper testing is crucial to ensure blocks work correctly and consistently.

## Creating and Testing a New Block

Follow these steps to create and test a new block:

1. **Create a new Python file** in the `backend/blocks` directory. Name it descriptively and use snake_case. For example: `get_wikipedia_summary.py`.

2. **Import necessary modules and create a class that inherits from `Block`**. Make sure to include all necessary imports for your block.

 Every block should contain the following:

   ```python
   from backend.data.block import Block, BlockSchema, BlockOutput
   ```

   Example for the Wikipedia summary block:

   ```python
   from backend.data.block import Block, BlockSchema, BlockOutput
   from backend.utils.get_request import GetRequest
   import requests

   class WikipediaSummaryBlock(Block, GetRequest):
       # Block implementation will go here
   ```

3. **Define the input and output schemas** using `BlockSchema`. These schemas specify the data structure that the block expects to receive (input) and produce (output).

   - The input schema defines the structure of the data the block will process. Each field in the schema represents a required piece of input data.
   - The output schema defines the structure of the data the block will return after processing. Each field in the schema represents a piece of output data.

   Example:

   ```python
   class Input(BlockSchema):
       topic: str  # The topic to get the Wikipedia summary for

   class Output(BlockSchema):
       summary: str  # The summary of the topic from Wikipedia
       error: str  # Any error message if the request fails
   ```

4. **Implement the `__init__` method, including test data and mocks:**

    !!! important
        Use UUID generator (e.g. https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) for every new block `id` and *do not* make up your own. Alternatively, you can run this python code to generate an uuid: `print(__import__('uuid').uuid4())`

   ```python
   def __init__(self):
       super().__init__(
           # Unique ID for the block, used across users for templates
           # If you are an AI leave it as is or change to "generate-proper-uuid"
           id="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
           input_schema=WikipediaSummaryBlock.Input,  # Assign input schema
           output_schema=WikipediaSummaryBlock.Output,  # Assign output schema

            # Provide sample input, output and test mock for testing the block

           test_input={"topic": "Artificial Intelligence"},
           test_output=("summary", "summary content"),
           test_mock={"get_request": lambda url, json: {"extract": "summary content"}},
       )
   ```

   - `id`: A unique identifier for the block.

   - `input_schema` and `output_schema`: Define the structure of the input and output data.

   Let's break down the testing components:

   - `test_input`: This is a sample input that will be used to test the block. It should be a valid input according to your Input schema.

   - `test_output`: This is the expected output when running the block with the `test_input`. It should match your Output schema. For non-deterministic outputs or when you only want to assert the type, you can use Python types instead of specific values. In this example, `("summary", str)` asserts that the output key is "summary" and its value is a string.

   - `test_mock`: This is crucial for blocks that make network calls. It provides a mock function that replaces the actual network call during testing. 

     In this case, we're mocking the `get_request` method to always return a dictionary with an 'extract' key, simulating a successful API response. This allows us to test the block's logic without making actual network requests, which could be slow, unreliable, or rate-limited.

5. **Implement the `run` method with error handling:**, this should contain the main logic of the block:

   ```python
   def run(self, input_data: Input, **kwargs) -> BlockOutput:
       try:
           topic = input_data.topic
           url = f"https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/{topic}"

           response = self.get_request(url, json=True)
           yield "summary", response['extract']

       except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
           yield "error", f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}"
       except requests.RequestException as e:
           yield "error", f"Request to Wikipedia failed: {e}"
       except KeyError as e:
           yield "error", f"Error parsing Wikipedia response: {e}"
   ```

   - **Try block**: Contains the main logic to fetch and process the Wikipedia summary.
   - **API request**: Send a GET request to the Wikipedia API.
   - **Error handling**: Handle various exceptions that might occur during the API request and data processing.
   - **Yield**: Use `yield` to output the results.

### Blocks with authentication

Our system supports auth offloading for API keys and OAuth2 authorization flows.
Adding a block with API key authentication is straight-forward, as is adding a block
for a service that we already have OAuth2 support for.

Implementing the block itself is relatively simple. On top of the instructions above,
you're going to add a `credentials` parameter to the `Input` model and the `run` method:
```python
from autogpt_libs.supabase_integration_credentials_store.types import (
    APIKeyCredentials,
    OAuth2Credentials,
    Credentials,
)

from backend.data.block import Block, BlockOutput, BlockSchema
from backend.data.model import CredentialsField


# API Key auth:
class BlockWithAPIKeyAuth(Block):
    class Input(BlockSchema):
        credentials = CredentialsField(
            provider="github",
            supported_credential_types={"api_key"},
            required_scopes={"repo"},
            description="The GitHub integration can be used with "
            "any API key with sufficient permissions for the blocks it is used on.",
        )

    # ...

    def run(
        self,
        input_data: Input,
        *,
        credentials: APIKeyCredentials,
        **kwargs,
    ) -> BlockOutput:
        ...

# OAuth:
class BlockWithOAuth(Block):
    class Input(BlockSchema):
        credentials = CredentialsField(
            provider="github",
            supported_credential_types={"oauth2"},
            required_scopes={"repo"},
            description="The GitHub integration can be used with OAuth.",
        )

    # ...

    def run(
        self,
        input_data: Input,
        *,
        credentials: OAuth2Credentials,
        **kwargs,
    ) -> BlockOutput:
        ...

# API Key auth + OAuth:
class BlockWithAPIKeyAndOAuth(Block):
    class Input(BlockSchema):
        credentials = CredentialsField(
            provider="github",
            supported_credential_types={"api_key", "oauth2"},
            required_scopes={"repo"},
            description="The GitHub integration can be used with OAuth, "
            "or any API key with sufficient permissions for the blocks it is used on.",
        )

    # ...

    def run(
        self,
        input_data: Input,
        *,
        credentials: Credentials,
        **kwargs,
    ) -> BlockOutput:
        ...
```
The credentials will be automagically injected by the executor in the back end.

The `APIKeyCredentials` and `OAuth2Credentials` models are defined [here](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/master/rnd/autogpt_libs/autogpt_libs/supabase_integration_credentials_store/types.py).
To use them in e.g. an API request, you can either access the token directly:
```python
# credentials: APIKeyCredentials
response = requests.post(
    url,
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {credentials.api_key.get_secret_value()})",
    },
)

# credentials: OAuth2Credentials
response = requests.post(
    url,
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {credentials.access_token.get_secret_value()})",
    },
)
```
or use the shortcut `credentials.bearer()`:
```python
# credentials: APIKeyCredentials | OAuth2Credentials
response = requests.post(
    url,
    headers={"Authorization": credentials.bearer()},
)
```

#### Adding an OAuth2 service integration

To add support for a new OAuth2-authenticated service, you'll need to add an `OAuthHandler`.
All our existing handlers and the base class can be found [here][OAuth2 handlers].

Every handler must implement the following parts of the [`BaseOAuthHandler`] interface:
- `PROVIDER_NAME`
- `__init__(client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri)`
- `get_login_url(scopes, state)`
- `exchange_code_for_tokens(code)`
- `_refresh_tokens(credentials)`

As you can see, this is modeled after the standard OAuth2 flow.

Aside from implementing the `OAuthHandler` itself, adding a handler into the system requires two more things:
- Adding the handler class to `HANDLERS_BY_NAME` [here](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/master/autogpt_platform/backend/backend/integrations/oauth/__init__.py)
- Adding `{provider}_client_id` and `{provider}_client_secret` to the application's `Secrets` [here](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/e3f35d79c7e9fc6ee0cabefcb73e0fad15a0ce2d/autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/settings.py#L132)

[`BaseOAuthHandler`]: https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/master/autogpt_platform/backend/backend/integrations/oauth/base.py

#### Example: GitHub integration
- GitHub blocks with API key + OAuth2 support: [`blocks/github`](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/tree/master/autogpt_platform/backend/backend/blocks/github/)
- GitHub OAuth2 handler: [`integrations/oauth/github.py`](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/master/autogpt_platform/backend/backend/integrations/oauth/github.py)

## Key Points to Remember

- **Unique ID**: Give your block a unique ID in the **init** method.
- **Input and Output Schemas**: Define clear input and output schemas.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling in the `run` method.
- **Output Results**: Use `yield` to output results in the `run` method.
- **Testing**: Provide test input and output in the **init** method for automatic testing.

## Understanding the Testing Process

The testing of blocks is handled by `test_block.py`, which does the following:

1. It calls the block with the provided `test_input`.  
   If the block has a `credentials` field, `test_credentials` is passed in as well.
2. If a `test_mock` is provided, it temporarily replaces the specified methods with the mock functions.
3. It then asserts that the output matches the `test_output`.

For the WikipediaSummaryBlock:

- The test will call the block with the topic "Artificial Intelligence".
- Instead of making a real API call, it will use the mock function, which returns `{"extract": "summary content"}`.
- It will then check if the output key is "summary" and its value is a string.

This approach allows us to test the block's logic comprehensively without relying on external services, while also accommodating non-deterministic outputs.

## Tips for Effective Block Testing

1. **Provide realistic test_input**: Ensure your test input covers typical use cases.

2. **Define appropriate test_output**: 
   - For deterministic outputs, use specific expected values.
   - For non-deterministic outputs or when only the type matters, use Python types (e.g., `str`, `int`, `dict`).
   - You can mix specific values and types, e.g., `("key1", str), ("key2", 42)`.

3. **Use test_mock for network calls**: This prevents tests from failing due to network issues or API changes.

4. **Consider omitting test_mock for blocks without external dependencies**: If your block doesn't make network calls or use external resources, you might not need a mock.

5. **Consider edge cases**: Include tests for potential error conditions in your `run` method.

6. **Update tests when changing block behavior**: If you modify your block, ensure the tests are updated accordingly.

By following these steps, you can create new blocks that extend the functionality of the AutoGPT Agent Server.
