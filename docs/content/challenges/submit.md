# Submit a Challenge

If you have identified a task or problem that AutoGPT struggles with, you can submit it as a challenge for the community to tackle. Here's how you can submit a new challenge:

## How to Submit a Challenge

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `challenges` directory in the AutoGPT GitHub repository. Make sure to pick the right category. 
2. Name the file with a descriptive title for the challenge, using hyphens instead of spaces (e.g., `improve-context-understanding.md`).
3. In the file, follow the [challenge_template.md](challenge_template.md) to describe the problem, define the scope, and evaluate success.
4. Commit the file and create a pull request.

Once submitted, the community can review and discuss the challenge. If deemed appropriate, it will be added to the [List of Challenges](list.md).

If you're looking to contribute by working on an existing challenge, check out [Beat a Challenge](beat.md) for guidelines on how to get started.
