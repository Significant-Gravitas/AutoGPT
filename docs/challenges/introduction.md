# Introduction to Challenges

Welcome to the Auto-GPT Challenges page! This is a space where we encourage community members to collaborate and contribute towards improving Auto-GPT by identifying and solving challenges that Auto-GPT is not yet able to achieve.

## What are challenges?

Challenges are tasks or problems that Auto-GPT has difficulty solving or has not yet been able to accomplish. These may include improving specific functionalities, enhancing the model's understanding of specific domains, or even developing new features that the current version of Auto-GPT lacks.

## Why are challenges important?

Addressing challenges helps us improve Auto-GPT's performance, usability, and versatility. By working together to tackle these challenges, we can create a more powerful and efficient tool for everyone. It also allows the community to actively contribute to the project, making it a true open-source effort.

## How can you participate?

There are two main ways to get involved with challenges:

1. **Submit a Challenge**: If you have identified a task that Auto-GPT struggles with, you can submit it as a challenge. This allows others to see the issue and collaborate on finding a solution.
2. **Beat a Challenge**: If you have a solution or idea to tackle an existing challenge, you can contribute by working on the challenge and submitting your solution.

To learn more about submitting and beating challenges, please visit the [List of Challenges](list.md), [Submit a Challenge](submit.md), and [Beat a Challenge](beat.md) pages.

We look forward to your contributions and the exciting solutions that the community will develop together to make Auto-GPT even better!
