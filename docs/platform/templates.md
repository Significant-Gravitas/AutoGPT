# Templates

## Overview

Templates are saved input configurations that let you re-run an agent with the same inputs quickly. Instead of filling in every input field each time, you can save a set of inputs as a template and trigger it again with one click.

## Creating a Template

Templates are created from previously completed tasks:

1. Go to your [Agent Library](agent-library.md) and open the agent
2. Find a completed task in the left-hand pane whose inputs you want to reuse
3. Click the **three dots** (⋯) on the task
4. Select **Save as Template**
5. Give the template a **name** and **description**
6. Click **Save**

The template captures all the input values that were used for that task.

## Using a Template

To run an agent using a saved template:

1. Open the agent from your library
2. Switch to the **Templates** tab on the left-hand side
3. Click on the template you want to use
4. The agent will run with the saved input values

## Managing Templates

Templates are listed under the **Templates** tab on your agent's detail page. The tab shows the count of available templates (e.g., `Templates 3`).

## When to Use Templates

Templates are particularly useful for:

- **Recurring tasks**: When you run an agent regularly with the same inputs (e.g., a daily SEO report for the same keyword)
- **Standard configurations**: When you've found input settings that work well and want to reuse them
- **Quick re-runs**: When you want to repeat a successful task without re-entering all the inputs

{% hint style="info" %}
Templates save the **input values** only — they do not save any settings or modifications to the agent itself. If you edit the agent's blocks or connections, existing templates will still use the saved input values with the updated agent design.
