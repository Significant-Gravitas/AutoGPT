# AutoPilot

## Overview

AutoPilot is your AI assistant built directly into the AutoGPT Platform. It can perform virtually any action on the platform through natural conversation — from running agents to generating images, conducting research, and even building entire agents for you.

## Accessing AutoPilot

AutoPilot is always available by clicking the **Home** button in the top-left of the navigation bar, or by navigating directly to [platform.agpt.co](https://platform.agpt.co).

## What AutoPilot Can Do

AutoPilot has access to the full power of the platform. Here's what it can help you with:

### Run Agents

Ask AutoPilot to run any agent in your library. It will handle filling in the inputs and executing the task for you.

### Build Agents

Describe the workflow you want and AutoPilot will create an agent for you in the builder. You can also ask it to edit your existing agents or modify agents you've added from the marketplace.

### Browse the Marketplace

Ask AutoPilot to find agents for a specific use case and it will search the marketplace for you.

### Execute Blocks Directly

AutoPilot can run individual blocks without building a full agent, giving it direct access to around **400 tools and counting**. This means you can:

- **Conduct research** with Perplexity
- **Generate images** with the latest image models
- **Edit pictures** using AI image editing blocks
- **Generate videos** using video generation blocks
- **Run any model** on inference services like Replicate
- **Make custom HTTP requests** to any API
- **Write and execute code**, including delegating coding tasks to Claude Code

### Manage Your Library

AutoPilot can help you manage your agent library, view task results, set up schedules, and more.

## Tips for Using AutoPilot

- **Be specific**: The more detail you provide, the better AutoPilot can assist you. Instead of "make me an agent", try "build me an agent that takes a blog topic as input, generates an outline with Claude, then writes the full article".
- **Iterate**: You can refine results by asking follow-up questions or requesting changes.
- **Explore capabilities**: If you're unsure whether AutoPilot can do something, just ask — it has access to a vast number of tools through the platform's block system.

## AutoPilot vs. the Agent Builder

| | AutoPilot | Agent Builder |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| **Best for** | Quick tasks, exploration, one-off actions | Reusable workflows, complex multi-step agents |
| **How it works** | Conversational — describe what you want | Visual — drag, drop, and connect blocks |
| **Reusability** | Actions are one-off unless you ask it to build an agent | Agents are saved and can be re-run, scheduled, or shared |
| **Block access** | Can run any block directly without an agent | Blocks must be connected into a workflow |

Both are powerful tools. Use AutoPilot for quick tasks and exploration, and the Agent Builder when you want to create reusable, automated workflows.
