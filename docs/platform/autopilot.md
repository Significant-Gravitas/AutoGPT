# AutoPilot

## Overview

AutoPilot is your AI assistant built directly into the AutoGPT Platform. It can perform virtually any action on the platform through natural conversation — from running agents to generating images, conducting research, and even building entire agents for you.

## Accessing AutoPilot

AutoPilot is always available by clicking the **Home** button in the top-left of the navigation bar, or by navigating directly to [platform.agpt.co](https://platform.agpt.co).

## What AutoPilot Can Do

AutoPilot has access to the full power of the platform. Here's what it can help you with:

### Run Agents

Ask AutoPilot to run any agent in your library. It will handle filling in the inputs and executing the task for you.

### Build Agents

Describe the workflow you want and AutoPilot will create an agent for you in the builder. You can also ask it to edit your existing agents or modify agents you've added from the marketplace.

### Browse the Marketplace

Ask AutoPilot to find agents for a specific use case and it will search the marketplace for you.

### Execute Blocks Directly

AutoPilot can run individual blocks without building a full agent, giving it direct access to around **400 tools and counting**. This means you can:

- **Conduct research** with Perplexity
- **Generate images** with the latest image models
- **Edit pictures** using AI image editing blocks
- **Generate videos** using video generation blocks
- **Run any model** on inference services like Replicate
- **Make custom HTTP requests** to any API
- **Write and execute code**, including delegating coding tasks to Claude Code

### Manage Your Library

AutoPilot can help you manage your agent library, view task results, set up schedules, and more.

## Tips for Using AutoPilot

- **Be specific**: The more detail you provide, the better AutoPilot can assist you. Instead of "make me an agent", try "build me an agent that takes a blog topic as input, generates an outline with Claude, then writes the full article".
- **Iterate**: You can refine results by asking follow-up questions or requesting changes.
- **Explore capabilities**: If you're unsure whether AutoPilot can do something, just ask — it has access to a vast number of tools through the platform's block system.

## AutoPilot vs. the Agent Builder

AutoPilot and the Agent Builder are two ways to achieve the same things on the platform. AutoPilot can do anything the builder can — including creating and editing full, reusable agents — and it can also run blocks directly without building an agent first.

| | AutoPilot | Agent Builder |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| **Who is it for** | Everyone — no technical knowledge required | Technical users with a grasp of visual programming |
| **Best for** | Natural language interaction, doing things fast, and accessing blocks directly | Hands-on visual control over exactly how an agent is wired together |
| **How it works** | Conversational — describe what you want | Visual — drag, drop, and connect blocks on a canvas |
| **Can build agents** | Yes — describe what you want and it builds the agent for you | Yes — you build the agent manually |
| **Can edit agents** | Yes — including agents from the marketplace | Yes — full visual editing |
| **Block access** | Can run any block directly without building an agent | Blocks must be connected into an agent workflow |

Choose whichever approach suits you. Many users use both — AutoPilot for speed, and the builder when they want fine-grained visual control over their workflow.
