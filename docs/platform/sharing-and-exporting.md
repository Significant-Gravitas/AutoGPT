# Sharing & Exporting Agents

## Overview

There are several ways to share agents and their outputs with others on the AutoGPT Platform. This guide covers all the available options.

## Sharing Options

### Share Task Output via URL

Every completed task has a unique URL that can be shared with others. To share a task result:

1. Go to your [Agent Library](agent-library.md) and open the agent
2. Click on the completed task you want to share
3. Copy the task URL from your browser's address bar
4. Send the URL to anyone — they can view the task's inputs and outputs directly

### Publish to the Marketplace

The most visible way to share an agent is to publish it to the [Marketplace](marketplace.md). Published agents are discoverable by all platform users and go through a review process by the AutoGPT team.

See [Publishing an Agent](marketplace.md#publishing-an-agent) for the full guide.

### Export as a File

For sharing agents privately — without publishing to the marketplace — you can export an agent as a file:

1. Go to your [Agent Library](agent-library.md) and open the agent
2. Click the **three dots** (⋯) on the far right
3. Select **Export Agent to File**
4. The agent file will download to your computer

You can then send this file to anyone via email, messaging, or any other method.

### Import a Shared File

To import an agent file someone has shared with you:

1. Go to your [Agent Library](agent-library.md)
2. Click **Upload Agent** at the top
3. Select the agent file
4. The agent will be added to your library

## Teams & Collaboration

Team and organisation features are not yet available on the platform. Currently, the only way to share agents privately between users is through the file export/import process described above.
