# Getting Started with AutoGPT (Cloud)

## Introduction

This guide will get you up and running on the hosted AutoGPT Platform at [platform.agpt.co](https://platform.agpt.co). No installation, Docker, or API keys required — just sign up and start building.

{% endhint %}

## Creating Your Account

1. Navigate to [platform.agpt.co](https://platform.agpt.co)
2. Click **Sign Up** and create your account
3. Once signed in, you'll land on the **AutoPilot** home screen

That's it — you're ready to go. The cloud platform comes with built-in credits and pre-configured API keys for services like OpenAI and Replicate, so you can start using AI blocks immediately without providing your own keys.

## Platform Navigation

The AutoGPT Platform has four main areas, accessible from the navigation bar at the top of every screen:

| Nav Button | URL | Description |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| **Home** | [platform.agpt.co](https://platform.agpt.co) | AutoPilot — your AI assistant for the platform |
| **Build** | [platform.agpt.co/build](https://platform.agpt.co/build) | Agent Builder — visual editor for creating agents |
| **Agents** | [platform.agpt.co/library](https://platform.agpt.co/library) | Your Agent Library — all your saved agents |
| **Marketplace** | [platform.agpt.co/marketplace](https://platform.agpt.co/marketplace) | Community marketplace for discovering agents |

Your **credit balance** is displayed in the top-right corner of the screen at all times. Your **profile menu** (top-right avatar) gives you access to account settings, integrations, and agent publishing.

## What to Do First

Here are three great ways to get started:

### Option 1: Chat with AutoPilot

Click **Home** in the nav bar to open AutoPilot. You can ask it to do almost anything on the platform — browse the marketplace, run agents, build agents, generate images, conduct research, and more. It's the fastest way to experience the platform.

### Option 2: Add an Agent from the Marketplace

1. Click **Marketplace** in the nav bar
2. Browse or search for an agent that interests you
3. Click on an agent to view its details
4. Click **Add to Library**
5. Navigate to **Agents** to find it in your library
6. Click on the agent and press **New Task** to run it

### Option 3: Build Your Own Agent

1. Click **Build** in the nav bar to open the Agent Builder
2. Open the Blocks menu on the left-hand side
3. Add an **Input Block**, an **AI Text Generator Block**, and an **Output Block**
4. Connect them together by dragging between their pins
5. Press **Ctrl+S** or click the save button to save your agent
6. Navigate to **Agents** to find and run it

## Key Concepts

Before diving deeper, here are the core concepts you'll encounter:

- **Agent**: An automated workflow you design to perform specific tasks. Agents are made up of connected blocks.
- **Block**: A single action within an agent — such as generating text with AI, sending an email, or looking up data. There are hundreds of blocks integrating with many platforms.
- **Task**: A single execution of an agent. When you run an agent with a set of inputs, that creates a task. You can view the task's inputs, outputs, and credit cost.
- **AutoPilot**: Your AI assistant that can perform any action on the platform through natural conversation.
- **Marketplace**: A public library of community-built agents you can add to your own library.
- **Credits**: The currency used to run blocks. Each block has its own price. Your balance is shown in the top-right corner.
