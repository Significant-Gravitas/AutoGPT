# Marketplace

## Overview

The AutoGPT Marketplace is a public library of agents created by the community and by the AutoGPT team. You can discover agents for a wide range of use cases, add them to your library with one click, and even publish your own agents for others to use.

**URL:** [platform.agpt.co/marketplace](https://platform.agpt.co/marketplace)

**Access:** Click **Marketplace** in the navigation bar.

## Browsing the Marketplace

The marketplace allows you to:

- **Search** for agents by name or keyword
- **Browse by category** to explore different use cases
- **View agent details** by clicking on any agent

### Agent Detail Page

Each agent in the marketplace has a dedicated page that includes:

- **Title and description** of what the agent does
- **Creator information** — who built the agent and a link to their other agents
- **Video** (when available) — a demonstration of the agent in action
- **Output showcase** (when available) — examples of the agent's results
- **Instructions** — guidance on how to run the agent and what to expect

## Adding an Agent to Your Library

When you find an agent you want to use:

1. Click on the agent to open its marketplace page
2. Click the **Add to Library** button

The agent will immediately appear in your [Agent Library](agent-library.md), where you can run it, schedule it, or edit it.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you already have the agent in your library, the button changes to **See Runs**, which takes you directly to that agent in your library.
{% endhint %}

### For Self-Hosted Users

If you are not logged into the cloud platform and are instead self-hosting, you will see a **Download** button instead of "Add to Library". This downloads the agent as a file which you can import into your local instance. See [Download & Import an Agent](download-agent-from-marketplace-local.md) for details.

## Publishing an Agent

You can publish your own agents to the marketplace for the community to discover and use.

### How to Publish

1. Click your **profile picture** in the top-right corner of any screen
2. Select **Publish an Agent**
3. Choose the agent you want to publish from your list of recent agents
4. Fill out the publishing form:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Title** | The name of your agent as it will appear in the marketplace |
| **Subheader** | A short tagline for your agent |
| **Slug** | A URL-friendly identifier (e.g., `resume-rewriter`) |
| **Thumbnail Images** | Upload images — the first image becomes the marketplace thumbnail |
| **YouTube Video Link** | Optional — a video demonstrating your agent |
| **Category** | Select the most relevant category for your agent |
| **Description** | A detailed explanation of what your agent does |
| **Agent Output Demo** | Optional — a short video showing the agent's results in action |
| **Instructions** | Explain to users how to run this agent and what to expect |
| **Recommended Schedule** | Suggest when users should run this agent for best results |

5. Click **Submit for Review**

### Review Process

After submission, a member of the AutoGPT team will review your agent against curation standards. If approved, your agent will be published to the marketplace and visible to all users.

{% hint style="info" %}
Creator monetisation (earning money from your published agents) is planned but not yet implemented.
{% endhint %}

## Editing Marketplace Agents

When you add a marketplace agent to your library, you get your own copy. You are free to edit it in the builder just like any agent you've created yourself. Your changes only affect your copy — the original marketplace listing is not modified.
