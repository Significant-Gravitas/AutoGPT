## Platform Components <a href="#platform-components" id="platform-components"></a>

### Agents and Workflows <a href="#agents-and-workflows" id="agents-and-workflows"></a>

In the platform, you can create highly customized workflows to build agents. An agent is essentially an automated workflow that you design to perform specific tasks or processes. Create customized workflows to build agents for various tasks, including:

* Data processing and analysis
* Task scheduling and management
* Communication and notification systems
* Integration between different software tools
* AI-powered decision making and content generation

### Blocks as Integrations <a href="#blocks-as-integrations" id="blocks-as-integrations"></a>

Blocks represent actions and are the building blocks of your workflows, including:

* Connections to external services
* Data processing tools
* AI models for various tasks
* Custom scripts or functions
* Conditional logic and decision-making components

You can learn more under: [Build your own Blocks](https://docs.agpt.co/platform/new_blocks/)

## Available Language Models <a href="#available-language-models" id="available-language-models"></a>

The platform comes pre-integrated with cutting-edge LLM providers:

* OpenAI - https://openai.com/
* Anthropic - https://www.anthropic.com/
* Groq - https://groq.com/
* Llama - https://llamaindex.ai/
* AI/ML API - [https://aimlapi.com/](https://aimlapi.com/?utm_source=autogpt\&utm_medium=github\&utm_campaign=integration)
* AI/ML API provides 300+ AI models including Deepseek, Gemini, ChatGPT. The models run at enterprise-grade rate limits and uptimes.

## License Overview <a href="#license-overview" id="license-overview"></a>

We've adopted a dual-license approach to balance open collaboration with sustainable development:

* **MIT License**: The majority of the AutoGPT repository remains under this license.
* **Polyform Shield License**: Applies to the new `autogpt_platform` folder.

This strategy allows us to share previously closed-source components, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of developers and users.
