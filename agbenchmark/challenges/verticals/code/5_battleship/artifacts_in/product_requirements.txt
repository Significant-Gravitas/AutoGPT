Specifications for Battleship

Overview: Battleship is a two-player strategy game where each player places their fleet of ships on a grid and tries to sink the opponent's fleet by guessing their locations.
Players take turns calling out a row and column, attempting to name a square containing one of the opponent's ships.

The Grid: Each player's grid is a 10x10 grid, identified by rows (using numbers 1-10) and columns (using letters A-J).

Ships:

Carrier - 5 squares
Battleship - 4 squares
Cruiser - 3 squares
Submarine - 3 squares
Destroyer - 2 squares
Each ship occupies contiguous squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically.

Setup:

At the start of the game, each player places their fleet on their grid. This setup is hidden from the opponent.
The game begins with Player 1, followed by Player 2, and so on.
Taking Turns:

On a player's turn, they announce a grid square (e.g., "D5").
The opponent announces whether that square is a "hit" (if there's a part of a ship on that square) or "miss" (if the square is empty).
If a player hits a square occupied by a ship, they get another turn to guess. This continues until they make a miss, at which point their turn ends.
If a player hits all the squares occupied by a ship, the opponent must announce the sinking of that specific ship, e.g., "You sank my Battleship!"

Objective: The goal is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.

End of the Game: The game ends when one player has sunk all of the opponent's ships. The winner is the player who sinks all the opposing fleet first.
