This is the frontend for AutoGPT's next generation

## 🧢 Getting Started

This project uses [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager via **corepack**. [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) is a Node.js tool that automatically manages package managers without requiring global installations.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js 16.10+ installed. Corepack is included with Node.js by default.

### ⚠️ Migrating from yarn

> This project was previously using yarn1, make sure to clean up the old files if you set it up previously with yarn:
>
> ```bash
> rm -f yarn.lock && rm -rf node_modules
> ```
>
> Then follow the setup steps below.

### Setup

1. **Enable corepack** (run this once on your system):

   ```bash
   corepack enable
   ```

   This enables corepack to automatically manage pnpm based on the `packageManager` field in `package.json`.

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

3. **Start the backend** (required for API query generation):

   ```bash
   cd .. && docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The `dev` command automatically fetches the latest OpenAPI spec from the backend and generates the API client before starting the Next.js development server. This ensures the frontend queries are always in sync with the backend API.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Subsequent Runs

For subsequent development sessions, you need to ensure the backend is running and then start the frontend:

```bash
cd autogpt_platform && docker compose up -d
pnpm dev
```

Every time a new Front-end dependency is added by you or others, you will need to run `pnpm i` to install the new dependencies.

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server with automatic API client generation
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm start` - Start production server
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint and Prettier checks
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier
- `pnpm type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm test` - Run Playwright tests
- `pnpm test-ui` - Run Playwright tests with UI
- `pnpm fetch:openapi` - Fetch OpenAPI spec from backend
- `pnpm generate:api-client` - Generate API client from OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm generate:api-all` - Fetch OpenAPI spec and generate API client

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## 🔄 Data Fetching Strategy

> [!NOTE]
> The API client is automatically generated when you run `pnpm dev` (requires backend to be running). You only need to run the manual OpenAPI commands below if you want to generate the client separately or if you're working with a modified backend API that isn't running locally.

This project uses an auto-generated API client powered by [**Orval**](https://orval.dev/), which creates type-safe API clients from OpenAPI specifications.

### How It Works

1. **Backend Requirements**: Each API endpoint needs a summary and tag in the OpenAPI spec
2. **Operation ID Generation**: FastAPI generates operation IDs using the pattern `{method}{tag}{summary}`
3. **Spec Fetching**: The OpenAPI spec is fetched from `http://localhost:8006/openapi.json` and saved to the frontend
4. **Spec Transformation**: The OpenAPI spec is cleaned up using a custom transformer (see `autogpt_platform/frontend/src/app/api/transformers`)
5. **Client Generation**: Auto-generated client includes TypeScript types, API endpoints, and Zod schemas, organized by tags

### API Client Commands

```bash
# Fetch OpenAPI spec from backend and generate client
pnpm generate:api-all

# Only fetch the OpenAPI spec
pnpm fetch:openapi

# Only generate the client (after spec is fetched)
pnpm generate:api-client
```

### Using the Generated Client

The generated client provides React Query hooks for both queries and mutations:

#### Queries (GET requests)

```typescript
import { useGetV1GetNotificationPreferences } from "@/app/api/__generated__/endpoints/auth/auth";

const { data, isLoading, isError } = useGetV1GetNotificationPreferences({
  query: {
    select: (res) => res.data,
    // Other React Query options
  },
});
```

#### Mutations (POST, PUT, DELETE requests)

```typescript
import { useDeleteV2DeleteStoreSubmission } from "@/app/api/__generated__/endpoints/store/store";
import { getGetV2ListMySubmissionsQueryKey } from "@/app/api/__generated__/endpoints/store/store";
import { useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";

const queryClient = useQueryClient();

const { mutateAsync: deleteSubmission } = useDeleteV2DeleteStoreSubmission({
  mutation: {
    onSuccess: () => {
      // Invalidate related queries to refresh data
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({
        queryKey: getGetV2ListMySubmissionsQueryKey(),
      });
    },
  },
});

// Usage
await deleteSubmission({
  submissionId: submission_id,
});
```

#### Server Actions

For server-side operations, you can also use the generated client functions directly:

```typescript
import { postV1UpdateNotificationPreferences } from "@/app/api/__generated__/endpoints/auth/auth";

// In a server action
const preferences = {
  email: "user@example.com",
  preferences: {
    AGENT_RUN: true,
    ZERO_BALANCE: false,
    // ... other preferences
  },
  daily_limit: 0,
};

await postV1UpdateNotificationPreferences(preferences);
```

#### Server-Side Prefetching

For server-side components, you can prefetch data on the server and hydrate it in the client cache. This allows immediate access to cached data when queries are called:

```typescript
import { getQueryClient } from "@/lib/tanstack-query/getQueryClient";
import {
  prefetchGetV2ListStoreAgentsQuery,
  prefetchGetV2ListStoreCreatorsQuery
} from "@/app/api/__generated__/endpoints/store/store";
import { HydrationBoundary, dehydrate } from "@tanstack/react-query";

// In your server component
const queryClient = getQueryClient();

await Promise.all([
  prefetchGetV2ListStoreAgentsQuery(queryClient, {
    featured: true,
  }),
  prefetchGetV2ListStoreAgentsQuery(queryClient, {
    sorted_by: "runs",
  }),
  prefetchGetV2ListStoreCreatorsQuery(queryClient, {
    featured: true,
    sorted_by: "num_agents",
  }),
]);

return (
  <HydrationBoundary state={dehydrate(queryClient)}>
    <MainMarkeplacePage />
  </HydrationBoundary>
);
```

This pattern improves performance by serving pre-fetched data from the server while maintaining the benefits of client-side React Query features.

### Configuration

The Orval configuration is located in `autogpt_platform/frontend/orval.config.ts`. It generates two separate clients:

1. **autogpt_api_client**: React Query hooks for client-side data fetching
2. **autogpt_zod_schema**: Zod schemas for validation

For more details, see the [Orval documentation](https://orval.dev/) or check the configuration file.

## 🚩 Feature Flags

This project uses [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) for feature flags, allowing us to control feature rollouts and A/B testing.

### Using Feature Flags

#### Check if a feature is enabled

```typescript
import { Flag, useGetFlag } from "@/services/feature-flags/use-get-flag";

function MyComponent() {
  const isAgentActivityEnabled = useGetFlag(Flag.AGENT_ACTIVITY);

  if (!isAgentActivityEnabled) {
    return null; // Hide feature
  }

  return <div>Feature is enabled!</div>;
}
```

#### Protect entire components

```typescript
import { withFeatureFlag } from "@/services/feature-flags/with-feature-flag";

const MyFeaturePage = withFeatureFlag(MyPageComponent, "my-feature-flag");
```

### Testing with Feature Flags

For local development or running Playwright tests locally, use mocked feature flags by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_PW_TEST=true` in your `.env` file. This bypasses LaunchDarkly and uses the mock values defined in the code.

### Adding New Flags

1. Add the flag to the `Flag` enum in `use-get-flag.ts`
2. Add the flag type to `FlagValues` type
3. Add mock value to `mockFlags` for testing
4. Configure the flag in LaunchDarkly dashboard

## 📙 Storybook

Storybook is a powerful development environment for UI components. It allows you to build UI components in isolation, making it easier to develop, test, and document your components independently from your main application.

### Purpose in the Development Process

1. **Component Development**: Develop and test UI components in isolation.
2. **Visual Testing**: Easily spot visual regressions.
3. **Documentation**: Automatically document components and their props.
4. **Collaboration**: Share components with your team or stakeholders for feedback.

### How to Use Storybook

1. **Start Storybook**:
   Run the following command to start the Storybook development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm storybook
   ```

   This will start Storybook on port 6006. Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) in your browser to view your component library.

2. **Build Storybook**:
   To build a static version of Storybook for deployment, use:

   ```bash
   pnpm build-storybook
   ```

3. **Running Storybook Tests**:
   Storybook tests can be run using:

   ```bash
   pnpm test-storybook
   ```

4. **Writing Stories**:
   Create `.stories.tsx` files alongside your components to define different states and variations of your components.

By integrating Storybook into our development workflow, we can streamline UI development, improve component reusability, and maintain a consistent design system across the project.
