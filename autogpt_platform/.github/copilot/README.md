## 🛠️ How It Works

### For Python Development
- Recognizes FastAPI patterns and suggests appropriate imports
- Provides block implementation templates with proper schemas
- Suggests async/await patterns for I/O operations
- Includes error handling and validation patterns
- Recommends testing patterns with pytest

### For TypeScript Development
- Recognizes Next.js patterns and suggests proper imports
- Provides React component templates with TypeScript types
- Suggests React Query patterns for data fetching
- Includes proper error boundary and loading state handling
- Recommends Playwright testing patterns

### For AI Agent Development
- Understands block architecture and execution model
- Suggests proper input/output schema definitions
- Recommends integration patterns for external services
- Provides performance optimization suggestions
- Includes monitoring and observability patterns

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Creating a New Block
When you start typing a new block class, Copilot will suggest:
```python
class MyNewBlock(Block):
    """Description of what this block does."""
    
    class Input(BaseModel):
        # Copilot suggests proper field definitions
        
    class Output(BaseModel):
        # Copilot suggests proper output schema
        
    def run(self, input_data: Input, **kwargs) -> BlockOutput:
        # Copilot suggests implementation patterns
```

### Creating React Components
When creating React components, Copilot will suggest:
```typescript
interface MyComponentProps {
    // Copilot suggests proper TypeScript types
}

export const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({
    // Copilot suggests proper prop destructuring
}) => {
    // Copilot suggests React hooks and patterns
};
```

### API Endpoint Development
When creating FastAPI endpoints, Copilot will suggest:
```python
@router.post("/endpoint", response_model=ResponseModel)
async def my_endpoint(
    request: RequestModel,
    user_id: str = Depends(get_current_user),
) -> ResponseModel:
    # Copilot suggests proper error handling and validation
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Patterns
To add new code patterns:
1. Edit `patterns.yml` to include your template
2. Use placeholder syntax: `{{variable_name}}`
3. Include proper imports and error handling
4. Add corresponding test patterns

### Updating Domain Knowledge
To update domain-specific information:
1. Edit `domain.yml` to add new concepts or patterns
2. Include architectural decisions and best practices
3. Update integration patterns for new services
4. Add performance and security considerations

### Workspace Configuration
To customize workspace settings:
1. Edit `workspace.yml` to update file associations
2. Add new naming conventions or import patterns
3. Update development workflow descriptions
4. Include tool-specific configurations
