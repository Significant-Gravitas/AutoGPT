Transform any trending headline or broad topic into a polished, vertical short-form video in a single run.  
The agent automates research, scriptwriting, metadata creation, and Revid.ai rendering, returning one ready-to-publish MP4 plus its title, script and hashtags.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Input a topic or an exact news headline.  
2. The agent fetches live search results and selects the most engaging related story.  
3. Key facts are summarised into concise research notes.  
4. Claude writes a 30–35 second script with visual cues, a three-second hook, tension loops, and a call-to-action.  
5. GPT-4o generates an eye-catching title and one or two discoverability hashtags.  
6. The script is sent to a state-of-the-art AI video generator to render a single 9:16 MP4 (default: 720 p, 30 fps, voice “Brian”, style “movingImage”, music “Bladerunner 2049”).  
   – All voice, style and resolution settings can be adjusted in the Builder before you press ""Run"".  
7. Output delivered: Title, Script, Hashtags, Video URL.

KEY USE CASES
- Broad-topic explainers (e.g. “Artificial Intelligence” or “Climate Tech”).  
- Real-time newsjacking with a specific breaking headline.  
- Product-launch spotlights and quick event recaps while interest is high.  

BUSINESS VALUE
- One-click speed: from idea to finished video in minutes.  
- Consistent brand look: Revid presets keep voice, style and aspect ratio on spec.  
- No-code workflow: marketers create social video without design or development queues.  
- Cloud convenience: Auto-GPT Cloud users are pre-configured with all required keys.  
  Self-hosted users simply add OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity (OpenRouter/Jina) and Revid keys once.

IMPORTANT NOTES
- The agent outputs exactly one video per execution. Run it again for additional shorts.  
- Video rendering time varies; AI-generated footage may take several minutes.","[""writing""]",false,true
