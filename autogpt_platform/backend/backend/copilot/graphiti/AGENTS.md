# Graphiti Memory

This directory contains the Graphiti-backed memory integration for CoPilot.
This file is developer documentation only — it is NOT injected into LLM prompts.
Runtime prompt instructions live in `prompting.py:get_graphiti_supplement()`.

## Scope

- Keep Graphiti and FalkorDB-specific logic in this package.
- Prefer changes here over scattering Graphiti behavior across unrelated copilot modules.

## Debugging

- Use raw FalkorDB queries to inspect stored nodes, episodes, and `RELATES_TO` facts before changing retrieval behavior.
- Distinguish user-provided facts, assistant-generated findings, and provenance/meta entities when evaluating memory quality.

## Design Intent

- Preserve per-user isolation through `group_id`-scoped databases and clients.
- Build a `MemoryScope` (`scope.py`) once where a request enters the memory code and pass it down; read `group_id` / `scope_key` / `redis_key(...)` off it rather than re-deriving them from a `(user_id, expert_id)` pair, and open drivers with `open_driver(scope)`.
- Be careful about memory pollution from assistant/tool phrasing; extraction quality matters as much as ingestion success.
- Keep warm-context and tool-driven recall resilient: failures should degrade gracefully rather than break chat execution.
- Recall goes through `recall.py` (what may be read back) and `recall_render.py` (how it is written out). Read facts with `search_facts` and episodes with `recent_episodes`; ingestion hands graphiti `previous_episode_uuids`. Code with its own Cypher uses the predicates there: `live_fact_predicate` for facts (the settings and admin fact lists), `forgotten_facts_clause` with `recallable_episode_predicate` for episodes (the dream gather and its session filter, the forget's redaction).
  - A fact is live while `expired_at` is unset and `status` is `active`, `tentative` or unset. It is forgotten when it is `retracted`, when its `expiration_reason` is `user_signal`, or when it has the pre-policy forget's shape: `expired_at` set with no `invalid_at` and no reason (`migrations/backfill_legacy_forgets.py` restamps those, after which that clause can go). An episode is recallable while it has no `redacted_at` and none of its `entity_edges` is forgotten.
  - What a forget guarantees: the fact and every episode it came from are hidden from warm context, `memory_search`, `memory_forget_search`, the settings fact list and count, the dream's input (its episodes and facts, and every chat session a hidden episode came from, left out whole) and ingestion's extraction context (the earlier episodes graphiti shows its prompts).
  - What it does not: admin audit surfaces (status `any`, the graph view) keep showing retracted facts and redacted episodes, on purpose. Entity and community summaries are not scrubbed, so a forgotten sentence can survive in a summary, including the ones graphiti's entity resolution reads; graphiti's edge resolution also still offers the retracted edge as a contradiction candidate.
  - Every forget goes through `recall_forget.retract`. Soft sets `status='retracted'` and `expiration_reason`, keeps an earlier `expired_at`, leaves `invalid_at` alone, and stamps `redacted_at` on every episode citing the fact. Hard does all of that first, then deletes the edge, each episode no remaining edge of any status cites, and each entity left with no fact and no mention (`recall_orphans.py`). A redaction or clean-up that fails is reported per edge as `cleanup_error`; recall hides the text regardless.
  - The dream keeps its own Cypher. Its gather and session filter (`dream/fetch.py`, `dream/hidden_sessions.py`) build on those predicates, and ratification (`dream/ratification.py`) only writes to a still-tentative, unexpired edge, so it cannot overwrite a forget.
  - A live fact whose valid time has ended (a past `invalid_at`, never expired) is still recalled, as history: it renders as `fact (valid: X — Y)`. Only a retired fact gets a retirement label, and "present" appears only while no end is known.

## Query Cookbook

Run everything from `autogpt_platform/backend` and use `poetry run ...`.

Get the `group_id` for a user (use `MemoryScope.for_expert(user_id, expert_id)`
for one of their experts; the snippets below take either):

```bash
poetry run python - <<'PY'
from backend.copilot.graphiti.scope import MemoryScope
print(MemoryScope.for_user("883cc9da-fe37-4863-839b-acba022bf3ef").group_id)
PY
```

Inspect graph counts:

```bash
poetry run python - <<'PY'
import asyncio
from backend.copilot.graphiti.falkordb_driver import open_driver
from backend.copilot.graphiti.scope import MemoryScope

USER_ID = "883cc9da-fe37-4863-839b-acba022bf3ef"
SCOPE = MemoryScope.for_user(USER_ID)

QUERIES = {
    "entities": "MATCH (n:Entity) RETURN count(n) AS count",
    "episodes": "MATCH (n:Episodic) RETURN count(n) AS count",
    "communities": "MATCH (n:Community) RETURN count(n) AS count",
    "relates_to_edges": "MATCH ()-[e:RELATES_TO]->() RETURN count(e) AS count",
}

async def run():
    driver = open_driver(SCOPE)
    try:
        for name, query in QUERIES.items():
            records, _, _ = await driver.execute_query(query)
            print(name, records[0]["count"])
    finally:
        await driver.close()

asyncio.run(run())
PY
```

List entities or relation-name counts:

```bash
poetry run python - <<'PY'
import asyncio
from backend.copilot.graphiti.falkordb_driver import open_driver
from backend.copilot.graphiti.scope import MemoryScope

USER_ID = "883cc9da-fe37-4863-839b-acba022bf3ef"
SCOPE = MemoryScope.for_user(USER_ID)

async def run():
    driver = open_driver(SCOPE)
    try:
        records, _, _ = await driver.execute_query(
            "MATCH (n:Entity) RETURN n.name AS name, n.summary AS summary ORDER BY n.name"
        )
        print("## entities")
        for row in records:
            print(row)

        records, _, _ = await driver.execute_query(
            """
            MATCH ()-[e:RELATES_TO]->()
            RETURN e.name AS relation, count(e) AS count
            ORDER BY count DESC, relation
            """
        )
        print("\\n## relation_counts")
        for row in records:
            print(row)
    finally:
        await driver.close()

asyncio.run(run())
PY
```

Inspect facts around one node:

```bash
poetry run python - <<'PY'
import asyncio
from backend.copilot.graphiti.falkordb_driver import open_driver
from backend.copilot.graphiti.scope import MemoryScope

USER_ID = "883cc9da-fe37-4863-839b-acba022bf3ef"
SCOPE = MemoryScope.for_user(USER_ID)
TARGET = "sarah"

async def run():
    driver = open_driver(SCOPE)
    try:
        records, _, _ = await driver.execute_query(
            """
            MATCH (a)-[e:RELATES_TO]->(b)
            WHERE (exists(a.name) AND toLower(a.name) = $target)
               OR (exists(b.name) AND toLower(b.name) = $target)
            RETURN a.name AS source, e.name AS relation, e.fact AS fact, b.name AS target
            ORDER BY e.created_at
            """,
            target=TARGET,
        )
        for row in records:
            print(row)
    finally:
        await driver.close()

asyncio.run(run())
PY
```

Inspect all chat messages for a user:

```bash
poetry run python - <<'PY'
import asyncio
from prisma import Prisma

USER_ID = "883cc9da-fe37-4863-839b-acba022bf3ef"

async def run():
    db = Prisma()
    await db.connect()
    try:
        rows = await db.query_raw(
            '''
            select cm."sessionId" as session_id,
                   cm.sequence,
                   cm.role,
                   left(cm.content, 260) as content,
                   cm."createdAt" as created_at
            from "ChatMessage" cm
            join "ChatSession" cs on cs.id = cm."sessionId"
            where cs."userId" = $1
            order by cm."createdAt", cm.sequence
            ''',
            USER_ID,
        )
        for row in rows:
            print(row)
    finally:
        await db.disconnect()

asyncio.run(run())
PY
```

Notes:

- `RELATES_TO` edges hold semantic facts. Inspect `e.name` and `e.fact`.
- `MENTIONS` edges are provenance from episodes to extracted nodes.
- Prefer directed queries `->` when checking for duplicates; undirected matches double-count mirrored edges.
