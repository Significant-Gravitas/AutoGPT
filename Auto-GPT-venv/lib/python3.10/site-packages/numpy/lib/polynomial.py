    Returns the coefficients of the polynomial whose leading coefficient

    A square matrix (or array, which will be treated as a matrix) can also
    be given, in which case the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial
    of the matrix are returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq_of_zeros : array_like, shape (N,) or (N, N)
        A sequence of polynomial roots, or a square array or matrix object.

    Returns
    -------

    Notes
    -----
    Specifying the roots of a polynomial still leaves one degree of
    freedom, typically represented by an undetermined leading
    coefficient. [1]_ In the case of this function, that coefficient -
    the first one in the returned array - is always taken as one. (If
    for some reason you have one other point, the only automatic way
    presently to leverage that information is to use ``polyfit``.)

    The characteristic polynomial, :math:`p_a(t)`, of an `n`-by-`n`
    matrix **A** is given by

        :math:`p_a(t) = \\mathrm{det}(t\\, \\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{A})`,

    where **I** is the `n`-by-`n` identity matrix. [2]_

    Least squares polynomial fit.

    Fit a polynomial ``p(x) = p[0] * x**deg + ... + p[deg]`` of degree `deg`
    to points `(x, y)`. Returns a vector of coefficients `p` that minimises
    the squared error in the order `deg`, `deg-1`, ... `0`.

    The `Polynomial.fit <numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial.fit>` class
    method is recommended for new code as it is more stable numerically. See
    the documentation of the method for more information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (M,)
        x-coordinates of the M sample points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample
        points sharing the same x-coordinates can be fitted at once by
        passing in a 2D-array that contains one dataset per column.
    deg : int
        Degree of the fitting polynomial
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values smaller than
        this relative to the largest singular value will be ignored. The
        default value is len(x)*eps, where eps is the relative precision of
        the float type, about 2e-16 in most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining nature of return value. When it is False (the
        default) just the coefficients are returned, when True diagnostic
        information from the singular value decomposition is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (M,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the weight ``w[i]`` applies to the unsquared
        residual ``y[i] - y_hat[i]`` at ``x[i]``. Ideally the weights are
        chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]`` all have the
        same variance.  When using inverse-variance weighting, use
        ``w[i] = 1/sigma(y[i])``.  The default value is None.
    cov : bool or str, optional
        If given and not `False`, return not just the estimate but also its
        covariance matrix. By default, the covariance are scaled by
        chi2/dof, where dof = M - (deg + 1), i.e., the weights are presumed
        to be unreliable except in a relative sense and everything is scaled
        such that the reduced chi2 is unity. This scaling is omitted if
        ``cov='unscaled'``, as is relevant for the case that the weights are
        w = 1/sigma, with sigma known to be a reliable estimate of the
        uncertainty.

    Returns
    -------
    p : ndarray, shape (deg + 1,) or (deg + 1, K)
        Polynomial coefficients, highest power first.  If `y` was 2-D, the
        coefficients for `k`-th data set are in ``p[:,k]``.

    residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond
        These values are only returned if ``full == True``

        - residuals -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
        - rank -- the effective rank of the scaled Vandermonde
           coefficient matrix
        - singular_values -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde
           coefficient matrix
        - rcond -- value of `rcond`.

        For more details, see `numpy.linalg.lstsq`.

    V : ndarray, shape (M,M) or (M,M,K)
        Present only if ``full == False`` and ``cov == True``.  The covariance
        matrix of the polynomial coefficient estimates.  The diagonal of
        this matrix are the variance estimates for each coefficient.  If y
        is a 2-D array, then the covariance matrix for the `k`-th data set
        are in ``V[:,:,k]``


    Warns
    -----
    RankWarning
        The rank of the coefficient matrix in the least-squares fit is
        deficient. The warning is only raised if ``full == False``.

        The warnings can be turned off by

        >>> import warnings
        >>> warnings.simplefilter('ignore', np.RankWarning)

    See Also

    polyval : Compute polynomial values.
    linalg.lstsq : Computes a least-squares fit.
    scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline : Computes spline fits.

    Notes
    -----
    The solution minimizes the squared error

    .. math::
        E = \\sum_{j=0}^k |p(x_j) - y_j|^2

    in the equations::

        x[0]**n * p[0] + ... + x[0] * p[n-1] + p[n] = y[0]
        x[1]**n * p[0] + ... + x[1] * p[n-1] + p[n] = y[1]
        ...
        x[k]**n * p[0] + ... + x[k] * p[n-1] + p[n] = y[k]

    The coefficient matrix of the coefficients `p` is a Vandermonde matrix.

    `polyfit` issues a `RankWarning` when the least-squares fit is badly
    conditioned. This implies that the best fit is not well-defined due
    to numerical error. The results may be improved by lowering the polynomial
    degree or by replacing `x` by `x` - `x`.mean(). The `rcond` parameter
    can also be set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting
    fit may be spurious: including contributions from the small singular
    values can add numerical noise to the result.

    Note that fitting polynomial coefficients is inherently badly conditioned
    when the degree of the polynomial is large or the interval of sample points
    is badly centered. The quality of the fit should always be checked in these
    cases. When polynomial fits are not satisfactory, splines may be a good
    alternative.

       A summary of the differences can be found in the

    If `p` is of length N, this function returns the value:

        ``p[0]*x**(N-1) + p[1]*x**(N-2) + ... + p[N-2]*x + p[N-1]``

    If `x` is a sequence, then ``p(x)`` is returned for each element of ``x``.
    If `x` is another polynomial then the composite polynomial ``p(x(t))``
    is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : array_like or poly1d object
       1D array of polynomial coefficients (including coefficients equal
       to zero) from highest degree to the constant term, or an
       instance of poly1d.
    x : array_like or poly1d object
       A number, an array of numbers, or an instance of poly1d, at
       which to evaluate `p`.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray or poly1d
       If `x` is a poly1d instance, the result is the composition of the two
       polynomials, i.e., `x` is "substituted" in `p` and the simplified
       result is returned. In addition, the type of `x` - array_like or
       poly1d - governs the type of the output: `x` array_like => `values`
       array_like, `x` a poly1d object => `values` is also.

    See Also
    --------
    poly1d: A polynomial class.

    Notes
    -----
    Horner's scheme [1]_ is used to evaluate the polynomial. Even so,
    for polynomials of high degree the values may be inaccurate due to
    rounding errors. Use carefully.

    If `x` is a subtype of `ndarray` the return value will be of the same type.

       A summary of the differences can be found in the

    A convenience class, used to encapsulate "natural" operations on
    polynomials so that said operations may take on their customary
    form in code (see Examples).

    Parameters
    ----------
    c_or_r : array_like
        The polynomial's coefficients, in decreasing powers, or if
        the value of the second parameter is True, the polynomial's
        roots (values where the polynomial evaluates to 0).  For example,
        ``poly1d([1, 2, 3])`` returns an object that represents
        :math:`x^2 + 2x + 3`, whereas ``poly1d([1, 2, 3], True)`` returns
        one that represents :math:`(x-1)(x-2)(x-3) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x -6`.
    r : bool, optional
        If True, `c_or_r` specifies the polynomial's roots; the default
        is False.
    variable : str, optional
        Changes the variable used when printing `p` from `x` to `variable`
        (see Examples).

    Examples
    --------
    Construct the polynomial :math:`x^2 + 2x + 3`:

    >>> p = np.poly1d([1, 2, 3])
    >>> print(np.poly1d(p))
       2
    1 x + 2 x + 3

    Evaluate the polynomial at :math:`x = 0.5`:

    >>> p(0.5)
    4.25

    Find the roots:

    >>> p.r
    array([-1.+1.41421356j, -1.-1.41421356j])
    >>> p(p.r)
    array([ -4.44089210e-16+0.j,  -4.44089210e-16+0.j]) # may vary

    These numbers in the previous line represent (0, 0) to machine precision

    Show the coefficients:

    >>> p.c
    array([1, 2, 3])

    Display the order (the leading zero-coefficients are removed):

    >>> p.order
    2

    Show the coefficient of the k-th power in the polynomial
    (which is equivalent to ``p.c[-(i+1)]``):

    >>> p[1]
    2

    Polynomials can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided
    (returns quotient and remainder):

    >>> p * p
    poly1d([ 1,  4, 10, 12,  9])

    >>> (p**3 + 4) / p
    (poly1d([ 1.,  4., 10., 12.,  9.]), poly1d([4.]))

    ``asarray(p)`` gives the coefficient array, so polynomials can be
    used in all functions that accept arrays:

    >>> p**2 # square of polynomial
    poly1d([ 1,  4, 10, 12,  9])

    >>> np.square(p) # square of individual coefficients
    array([1, 4, 9])

    The variable used in the string representation of `p` can be modified,
    using the `variable` parameter:

    >>> p = np.poly1d([1,2,3], variable='z')
    >>> print(p)
       2
    1 z + 2 z + 3

    Construct a polynomial from its roots:

    >>> np.poly1d([1, 2], True)
    poly1d([ 1., -3.,  2.])

    This is the same polynomial as obtained by:
