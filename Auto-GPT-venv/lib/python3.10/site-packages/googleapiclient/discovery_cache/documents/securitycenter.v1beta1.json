Examples include publicly accessible unprotected user data, public SSH access with weak or no passwords, etc. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able to access, modify, or delete data or execute unauthorized code within existing resources.",
            "Vulnerability: A high risk vulnerability can be easily discovered and exploited in combination with other vulnerabilities in order to gain direct access and the ability to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional access and privileges to cloud resources and workloads. An example is a database with weak or no passwords that is only accessible internally. This database could easily be compromised by an actor that had access to the internal network. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able to create new computational resources in an environment but not able to access data or execute code in existing resources.",
            "Vulnerability: A medium risk vulnerability could be used by an actor to gain access to resources or privileges that enable them to eventually (through multiple steps or a complex exploit) gain access and the ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate data. An example is a service account with access to more projects than it should have. If an actor gains access to the service account, they could potentially use that access to manipulate a project the service account was not intended to. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able to cause operational impact but may not access data or execute unauthorized code.",
            "Vulnerability: A low risk vulnerability hampers a security organization's ability to detect vulnerabilities or active threats in their deployment, or prevents the root cause investigation of security issues. An example is monitoring and logs being disabled for resource configurations and access. Threat: Indicates a threat that has obtained minimal access to an environment but is not able to access data, execute code, or create resources."

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).",
