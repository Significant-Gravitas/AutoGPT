# AutoGPT Contribution Guide
If you are reading this, you are probably looking for our **[contribution guide]**,
which is part of our [knowledge base].

You can find our immediate priorities and their progress on our public [kanban board].

[kanban board]: https://github.com/orgs/Significant-Gravitas/projects/1

## In short
1. Avoid duplicate work, issues, PRs etc.
2. We encourage you to collaborate with fellow community members on some of our bigger
   [todo's][kanban board]!
   * We highly recommend to post your idea and discuss it in the [dev channel].
4. Create a draft PR when starting work on bigger changes.
3. Please also consider contributing something other than code; see the
   [contribution guide] for options.
5. Clearly explain your changes when submitting a PR.
6. Don't submit stuff that's broken.
7. Avoid making unnecessary changes, especially if they're purely based on your personal
   preferences. Doing so is the maintainers' job. ;-)

If you wish to involve with the project (beyond just contributing PRs), please read the
wiki [catalyzing](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Nexus/wiki/Catalyzing) page.

In fact, why not just look through the whole wiki (it's only a few pages) and
hop on our Discord. See you there! :-)
