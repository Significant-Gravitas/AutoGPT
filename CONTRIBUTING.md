# AutoGPT Contribution Guide
If you are reading this, you are probably looking for our **[contribution guide]**,
which is part of our [knowledge base].

[knowledge base]: https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Nexus/wiki

## In short
1. Avoid duplicate work, issues, PRs etc.
2. Also consider contributing something other than code; see the [contribution guide]
   for options.
3. Create a draft PR before starting work on non-small changes. Also post your proposal
   in the [dev channel].
4. Clearly explain your changes when submitting a PR.
5. Don't submit stuff that's broken.
6. Avoid making unnecessary changes, especially if they're purely based on your personal
   preferences. Doing so is the maintainers' job.

## Why instructions like these are necessary
We would like to say "We value all contributions". After all, we are an open-source
project, so we should welcome any input that people are willing to give, right?

Well, the reality is that some contributions are SUPER-valuable, while others create
more trouble than they are worth and actually _create_ work for the core team. So to
ensure maximum chances of a smooth ride, please stick to the guidelines.

If you wish to involve with the project (beyond just contributing PRs), please read the
wiki [catalyzing](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Nexus/wiki/Catalyzing) page.

In fact, why not just look through the whole wiki (it's only a few pages) and
hop on our Discord. See you there! :-)
