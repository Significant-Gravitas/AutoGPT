- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Next.js 15, React, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- **Development**: Docker, Poetry, pnpm, Playwright, Storybook

## Build and Validation Instructions

### Essential Setup Commands

**Always run these commands in the correct directory and in this order:**

1. **Initial Setup** (required once):
   ```bash
   # Clone and enter repository
   git clone <repo> && cd AutoGPT
   
   # Start all services (database, redis, rabbitmq, clamav)
   cd autogpt_platform && docker compose --profile local up deps --build --detach
   ```

2. **Backend Setup** (always run before backend development):
   ```bash
   cd autogpt_platform/backend
   poetry install                    # Install dependencies
   poetry run prisma migrate dev     # Run database migrations
   poetry run prisma generate        # Generate Prisma client
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup** (always run before frontend development):
   ```bash
   cd autogpt_platform/frontend
   pnpm install                      # Install dependencies
   ```

### Runtime Requirements

**Critical:** Always ensure Docker services are running before starting development:
```bash
cd autogpt_platform && docker compose --profile local up deps --build --detach
```

**Python Version:** Use Python 3.11 (required; managed by Poetry via pyproject.toml)
**Node.js Version:** Use Node.js 21+ with pnpm package manager

### Development Commands

**Backend Development:**
```bash
cd autogpt_platform/backend
poetry run serve                     # Start development server (port 8000)
poetry run test                      # Run all tests (requires ~5 minutes)
poetry run pytest path/to/test.py    # Run specific test
poetry run format                    # Format code (Black + isort) - always run first
poetry run lint                      # Lint code (ruff) - run after format
```

**Frontend Development:**
```bash
cd autogpt_platform/frontend
pnpm dev                            # Start development server (port 3000) - use for active development
pnpm build                          # Build for production (only needed for E2E tests or deployment)
pnpm test                           # Run Playwright E2E tests (requires build first)
pnpm test-ui                        # Run tests with UI
pnpm format                         # Format and lint code
pnpm storybook                      # Start component development server
```

### Testing Strategy

**Backend Tests:**
- **Block Tests**: `poetry run pytest backend/blocks/test/test_block.py -xvs` (validates all blocks)
- **Specific Block**: `poetry run pytest 'backend/blocks/test/test_block.py::test_available_blocks[BlockName]' -xvs`
- **Snapshot Tests**: Use `--snapshot-update` when output changes, always review with `git diff`

**Frontend Tests:**
- **E2E Tests**: Always run `pnpm dev` before `pnpm test` (Playwright requires running instance)
- **Component Tests**: Use Storybook for isolated component development

### Critical Validation Steps

**Before committing changes:**
1. Run `poetry run format` (backend) and `pnpm format` (frontend)
2. Ensure all tests pass in modified areas
3. Verify Docker services are still running
4. Check that database migrations apply cleanly

**Common Issues & Workarounds:**
- **Prisma issues**: Run `poetry run prisma generate` after schema changes
- **Permission errors**: Ensure Docker has proper permissions
- **Port conflicts**: Check the `docker-compose.yml` file for the current list of exposed ports. You can list all mapped ports with:
- **Test timeouts**: Backend tests can take 5+ minutes, use `-x` flag to stop on first failure

## Project Layout & Architecture

### Core Architecture

**AutoGPT Platform** (`autogpt_platform/`):
- `backend/` - FastAPI server with async support
  - `backend/backend/` - Core API logic
  - `backend/blocks/` - Agent execution blocks
  - `backend/data/` - Database models and schemas
  - `schema.prisma` - Database schema definition
- `frontend/` - Next.js application
  - `src/app/` - App Router pages and layouts
  - `src/components/` - Reusable React components
  - `src/lib/` - Utilities and configurations
- `autogpt_libs/` - Shared Python utilities
- `docker-compose.yml` - Development stack orchestration

**Key Configuration Files:**
- `pyproject.toml` - Python dependencies and tooling
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies and scripts
- `schema.prisma` - Database schema and migrations
- `next.config.mjs` - Next.js configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Styling configuration

### Security & Middleware

**Cache Protection**: Backend includes middleware preventing sensitive data caching in browsers/proxies
**Authentication**: JWT-based with Supabase integration
**User ID Validation**: All data access requires user ID checks - verify this for any `data/*.py` changes

### Development Workflow

**GitHub Actions**: Multiple CI/CD workflows in `.github/workflows/`
- `platform-backend-ci.yml` - Backend testing and validation
- `platform-frontend-ci.yml` - Frontend testing and validation
- `platform-fullstack-ci.yml` - End-to-end integration tests

**Pre-commit Hooks**: Run linting and formatting checks
**Conventional Commits**: Use format `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(backend): add API`)

### Key Source Files

**Backend Entry Points:**
- `backend/backend/server/server.py` - FastAPI application setup
- `backend/backend/data/` - Database models and user management
- `backend/blocks/` - Agent execution blocks and logic

**Frontend Entry Points:**
- `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` - Root application layout
- `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` - Home page
- `frontend/src/lib/supabase/` - Authentication and database client

**Protected Routes**: Update `frontend/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` when adding protected routes

### Agent Block System

Agents are built using a visual block-based system where each block performs a single action. Blocks are defined in `backend/blocks/` and must include:
- Block definition with input/output schemas
- Execution logic with proper error handling
- Tests validating functionality

### Database & ORM

**Prisma ORM** with PostgreSQL backend including pgvector for embeddings:
- Schema in `schema.prisma`
- Migrations in `backend/migrations/`
- Always run `prisma migrate dev` and `prisma generate` after schema changes

## Environment Configuration

### Configuration Files Priority Order
1. **Backend**: `/backend/.env.default` → `/backend/.env` (user overrides)
2. **Frontend**: `/frontend/.env.default` → `/frontend/.env` (user overrides)  
3. **Platform**: `/.env.default` (Supabase/shared) → `/.env` (user overrides)
4. Docker Compose `environment:` sections override file-based config
5. Shell environment variables have highest precedence

### Docker Environment Setup
- All services use hardcoded defaults (no `${VARIABLE}` substitutions)
- The `env_file` directive loads variables INTO containers at runtime
- Backend/Frontend services use YAML anchors for consistent configuration
- Copy `.env.default` files to `.env` for local development customization

## Advanced Development Patterns

### Adding New Blocks
1. Create file in `/backend/backend/blocks/`
2. Inherit from `Block` base class with input/output schemas
3. Implement `run` method with proper error handling
4. Generate block UUID using `uuid.uuid4()`
5. Register in block registry
6. Write tests alongside block implementation
7. Consider how inputs/outputs connect with other blocks in graph editor

### API Development
1. Update routes in `/backend/backend/server/routers/`
2. Add/update Pydantic models in same directory
3. Write tests alongside route files
4. For `data/*.py` changes, validate user ID checks
5. Run `poetry run test` to verify changes

### Frontend Development
1. Components in `/frontend/src/components/`
2. Use existing UI components from `/frontend/src/components/ui/`
3. Add Storybook stories for component development
4. Test user-facing features with Playwright E2E tests
5. Update protected routes in middleware when needed

### Security Guidelines
**Cache Protection Middleware** (`/backend/backend/server/middleware/security.py`):
- Default: Disables caching for ALL endpoints with `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, private`
- Uses allow list approach for cacheable paths (static assets, health checks, public pages)
- Prevents sensitive data caching in browsers/proxies
- Add new cacheable endpoints to `CACHEABLE_PATHS`

### CI/CD Alignment
The repository has comprehensive CI workflows that test:
- **Backend**: Python 3.11-3.13, services (Redis/RabbitMQ/ClamAV), Prisma migrations, Poetry lock validation
- **Frontend**: Node.js 21, pnpm, Playwright with Docker Compose stack, API schema validation
- **Integration**: Full-stack type checking and E2E testing

Match these patterns when developing locally - the copilot setup environment mirrors these CI configurations.
