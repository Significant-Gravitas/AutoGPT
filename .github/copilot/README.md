class MyNewBlock(Block):
    class Input(BaseModel):
        field: str = Field(description="Auto-suggested with validation")
    
    class Output(BaseModel):
        result: str = Field(description="Detailed output description")
    
    def run(self, input_data: Input, **kwargs) -> BlockOutput:
        # Includes proper error handling and async patterns
        try:
            result = await self._process_data(input_data.field)
            return BlockOutput(id=self.id, data=self.Output(result=result))
        except Exception as e:
            raise Exception(f"Block execution failed: {str(e)}")
```

#### React Component Intelligence
```typescript
// Enhanced component suggestions with proper TypeScript and hooks
export const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({ prop }) => {
    const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
        queryKey: ['my-data', prop],
        queryFn: () => fetchData(prop),
        // Copilot suggests React Query patterns
    });
    
    // Includes error boundaries and loading states
    if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
    if (error) return <ErrorAlert error={error} />;
    
    return <ComponentContent data={data} />;
};
```

#### Platform-Aware API Development
```python
# Suggests FastAPI patterns with proper validation
@router.post("/endpoint", response_model=Response)
async def endpoint(
    request: Request,
    user_id: str = Depends(get_current_user),
) -> Response:
    # Includes authentication, validation, and error handling
    try:
        validate_user_permissions(user_id, request.resource_id)
        result = await process_request(request)
        return Response(data=result, status="success")
    except ValidationError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))
```
