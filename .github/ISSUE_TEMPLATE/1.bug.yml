        to see if an issue already exists for the same problem.

        Please provide a searchable summary of the issue in the title above ⬆️.

        ⚠️ SUPER-busy repo, please help the volunteer maintainers.
        The less time we spend here, the more time we spend building AutoGPT.
        
        Please help us help you:
        - Does it work on `stable` branch (https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/tree/stable)?
        - Does it work on current `master` (https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/tree/master)?
        - Search for existing issues, "add comment" is tidier than "new issue"
        - Ask on our Discord (https://discord.gg/autogpt)
        - Provide relevant info:
          - Provide commit-hash (`git rev-parse HEAD` gets it)
          - If it's a pip/packages issue, provide pip version, python version
          - If it's a crash, provide traceback.
