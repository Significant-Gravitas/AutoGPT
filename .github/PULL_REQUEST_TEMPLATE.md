<!-- 📢 Announcement
We've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes. While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:

Focus on a single, specific change.
Do not include any unrelated or "extra" modifications.
Provide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.
Ensure diffs are limited to the intended lines — no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).
For guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg
