## 🗣️ Speech Mode

Use this to use TTS for Auto-GPT

```
python -m autogpt --speak
```

## 🔍 Google API Keys Configuration

This section is optional, use the official google api if you are having issues with error 429 when running a google search.
To use the `google_official_search` command, you need to set up your Google API keys in your environment variables.

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. If you don't already have an account, create one and log in.
3. Create a new project by clicking on the "Select a Project" dropdown at the top of the page and clicking "New Project". Give it a name and click "Create".
4. Go to the [APIs & Services Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) and click "Enable APIs and Services". Search for "Custom Search API" and click on it, then click "Enable".
5. Go to the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page and click "Create Credentials". Choose "API Key".
6. Copy the API key and set it as an environment variable named `GOOGLE_API_KEY` on your machine. See setting up environment variables below.
7. [Enable](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/customsearch.googleapis.com) the Custom Search API on your project. (Might need to wait few minutes to propagate)
8. Go to the [Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/all) page and click "Add".
9. Set up your search engine by following the prompts. You can choose to search the entire web or specific sites.
10. Once you've created your search engine, click on "Control Panel" and then "Basics". Copy the "Search engine ID" and set it as an environment variable named `CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID` on your machine. See setting up environment variables below.

_Remember that your free daily custom search quota allows only up to 100 searches. To increase this limit, you need to assign a billing account to the project to profit from up to 10K daily searches._

### Setting up environment variables

For Windows Users:

```
setx GOOGLE_API_KEY "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
setx CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID "YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"

```

For macOS and Linux users:

```
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
export CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"

```

## Redis Setup

Install docker desktop.

Run:

```
docker run -d --name redis-stack-server -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest
```

See https://hub.docker.com/r/redis/redis-stack-server for setting a password and additional configuration.

Set the following environment variables:

```
MEMORY_BACKEND=redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=
```

Note that this is not intended to be run facing the internet and is not secure, do not expose redis to the internet without a password or at all really.

You can optionally set

```
WIPE_REDIS_ON_START=False
```

To persist memory stored in Redis.

You can specify the memory index for redis using the following:

```
MEMORY_INDEX=whatever
```

## 🌲 Pinecone API Key Setup

Pinecone enables the storage of vast amounts of vector-based memory, allowing for only relevant memories to be loaded for the agent at any given time.

1. Go to [pinecone](https://app.pinecone.io/) and make an account if you don't already have one.
2. Choose the `Starter` plan to avoid being charged.
3. Find your API key and region under the default project in the left sidebar.

### Setting up environment variables

In the `.env` file set:
- `PINECONE_API_KEY`
- `PINECONE_ENV` (something like: us-east4-gcp)
- `MEMORY_BACKEND=pinecone`

Alternatively, you can set them from the command line (advanced):

For Windows Users:

```
setx PINECONE_API_KEY "YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY"
setx PINECONE_ENV "Your pinecone region" # something like: us-east4-gcp
setx MEMORY_BACKEND "pinecone"
```

For macOS and Linux users:

```
export PINECONE_API_KEY="YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY"
export PINECONE_ENV="Your pinecone region" # something like: us-east4-gcp
export MEMORY_BACKEND="pinecone"
```

## Setting Your Cache Type

By default Auto-GPT is going to use LocalCache instead of redis or Pinecone.

To switch to either, change the `MEMORY_BACKEND` env variable to the value that you want:

`local` (default) uses a local JSON cache file
`pinecone` uses the Pinecone.io account you configured in your ENV settings
`redis` will use the redis cache that you configured

## View Memory Usage

1. View memory usage by using the `--debug` flag :)


## 🧠 Memory pre-seeding

```
# python scripts/data_ingestion.py -h 
usage: data_ingestion.py [-h] (--file FILE | --dir DIR) [--init] [--overlap OVERLAP] [--max_length MAX_LENGTH]

Ingest a file or a directory with multiple files into memory. Make sure to set your .env before running this script.

options:
  -h, --help               show this help message and exit
  --file FILE              The file to ingest.
  --dir DIR                The directory containing the files to ingest.
  --init                   Init the memory and wipe its content (default: False)
  --overlap OVERLAP        The overlap size between chunks when ingesting files (default: 200)
  --max_length MAX_LENGTH  The max_length of each chunk when ingesting files (default: 4000

# python scripts/data_ingestion.py --dir seed_data --init --overlap 200 --max_length 1000
```

This script located at scripts/data_ingestion.py, allows you to ingest files into memory and pre-seed it before running Auto-GPT. 

Memory pre-seeding is a technique that involves ingesting relevant documents or data into the AI's memory so that it can use this information to generate more informed and accurate responses.

To pre-seed the memory, the content of each document is split into chunks of a specified maximum length with a specified overlap between chunks, and then each chunk is added to the memory backend set in the .env file. When the AI is prompted to recall information, it can then access those pre-seeded memories to generate more informed and accurate responses.

This technique is particularly useful when working with large amounts of data or when there is specific information that the AI needs to be able to access quickly. 
By pre-seeding the memory, the AI can retrieve and use this information more efficiently, saving time, API call and improving the accuracy of its responses. 

You could for example download the documentation of an API, a Github repository, etc. and ingest it into memory before running Auto-GPT. 

⚠️ If you use Redis as your memory, make sure to run Auto-GPT with the WIPE_REDIS_ON_START set to False in your .env file.

⚠️For other memory backend, we currently forcefully wipe the memory when starting Auto-GPT. To ingest data with those memory backend, you can call the data_ingestion.py script anytime during an Auto-GPT run. 

Memories will be available to the AI immediately as they are ingested, even if ingested while Auto-GPT is running.

In the example above, the script initializes the memory, ingests all files within the seed_data directory into memory with an overlap between chunks of 200 and a maximum length of each chunk of 4000.
Note that you can also use the --file argument to ingest a single file into memory and that the script will only ingest files within the auto_gpt_workspace directory.

You can adjust the max_length and overlap parameters to fine-tune the way the docuents are presented to the AI when it "recall" that memory:

- Adjusting the overlap value allows the AI to access more contextual information from each chunk when recalling information, but will result in more chunks being created and therefore increase memory backend usage and OpenAI API requests.
- Reducing the max_length value will create more chunks, which can save prompt tokens by allowing for more message history in the context, but will also increase the number of chunks.
- Increasing the max_length value will provide the AI with more contextual information from each chunk, reducing the number of chunks created and saving on OpenAI API requests. However, this may also use more prompt tokens and decrease the overall context available to the AI.

## 💀 Continuous Mode ⚠️

Run the AI **without** user authorisation, 100% automated.
Continuous mode is not recommended.
It is potentially dangerous and may cause your AI to run forever or carry out actions you would not usually authorise.
Use at your own risk.

1. Run the `autogpt` python module in your terminal:

```
python -m autogpt --speak --continuous

```

2. To exit the program, press Ctrl + C

## GPT3.5 ONLY Mode

If you don't have access to the GPT4 api, this mode will allow you to use Auto-GPT!

```
python -m autogpt --speak --gpt3only
```

It is recommended to use a virtual machine for tasks that require high security measures to prevent any potential harm to the main computer's system and data.

## 🖼 Image Generation

By default, Auto-GPT uses DALL-e for image generation. To use Stable Diffusion, a [HuggingFace API Token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) is required.

Once you have a token, set these variables in your `.env`:

```
IMAGE_PROVIDER=sd
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN="YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN"
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

This experiment aims to showcase the potential of GPT-4 but comes with some limitations:

1. Not a polished application or product, just an experiment
2. May not perform well in complex, real-world business scenarios. In fact, if it actually does, please share your results!
3. Quite expensive to run, so set and monitor your API key limits with OpenAI!
