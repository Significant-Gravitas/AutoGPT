# afaas: Agent Framework as a Service

Welcome to the **afaas: Agent Framework as a Service** project! This project is a fork **AutoGPT** it aims to facilitate developments and provide additional functionalities, namely : 

1. **Separate Agent Functionalities**: Facilitate teamwork by dividing agent functionalities into four parts:
   - **Agent Main**: Focuses on UI ↔ Agent ↔ Database interfaces, supporting CRUD & Execution.
   - **Agent Loop**: Concentrates on the Agent execution logic.
   - **Agent Models**: Gather Settings and Configurations required to run an Agent. 
   - **Agent Strategies**: Emphasizes the creation of (dynamic) prompts for the Machine Learning Back-end.

2. **Support Multiple Users**: Allows multi-user, so you can provide your agent via an API/Service to multiple persons/programs.

3. **Support Multiple Agent Instances**: Enables work on different projects.

4. **Support Various Agent Types**: Facilitates the creation of specialist agents.

5. **Support Various Memory Back-ends**: Including AWS, Azure, and MongoDB.

<!--🚧 **Work in progress**: Please check the branch status for further information. 🚧-->

## Current status

27th of September : 
The Framework libraries are working, we are currently achieving an example of Agent implemented with the Framework and compatible with the [Agent Protocol](https://github.com/AI-Engineers-Foundation/agent-protocol) & AutoGPT Benchmarks. Other priorities are the support of more "Abilities" (tools 🔧 ), database-backends ( 📚 ).

## Contributing

Your contributions to this project are immensely valued. Here are currents needs : 
- **Anyone** with skills in Kubernetes :smile:
- **Back-End Developer :**
  - Join us to migrate AutoGPT Commands to Abilities
  - Join us to achieve the prototyped backends (AWS, Azure, MongoDB).
- **Front-end Developper**
  - Join us to develop a GUI
  - Join us to build a Project Website 
- Also **Anyone :** 
  - Join us to manage PR & Discord Server
  - ✅ ~~Build a User Guide to run our example.~~ => AutoGPT User Guide should
  - Build a Developper guide to create agents (Exposing only methods required to build Agents)
  - Build a Technical documentation to documents all the technical intricacies of the Framework
  - Offer suggestions, report potential issues, or propose new enhancements through GitHub issues.

For more detailed contribution guidelines, please refer to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Roadmap priorities : 
1. 🔄 Achieve the SimpleAgent example
2. 🔴 Compatibility with  [Agent Protocol](https://github.com/AI-Engineers-Foundation/agent-protocol) 
3. 🔴 Migrate AutoGPT Commands to Abilities **Help needed**
4. 🔴 Get a Developper Guide for easier adoption

## Setup and Execution

We recommend using AutoGPT guidelines.

## Framework Developper Guide

Welcome to the **Framework User Guide**. This guide helps developers understand and utilize the framework efficiently, allowing you to focus on creating agents with ease.

The primary goal of this framework is to provide a robust set of libraries, reducing complexities, so you can concentrate on building agents. We're actively seeking contributors to further enrich this framework.

🚧 **User Guide**: This guide is under development. Check back for updates. 🚧

### Tools (🌟 Contribution needed 🌟) - branch afaas - tools

Tools (currently named Abilities) are the interface between an agent and another system (OS, Application via API or other protocol, ect...) it is the arms and legs of an agent and it's capacity to act on it's environments. 

Our intent is to support at least : 
- Llm queries ✅ 
- Web search ⏳
- Filesystem interaction ⏳
- Code excecution ⏳
- Popular document formats : World,  PDF ⏳
- Image generation ⏳
- Git interation ⏳ 
- And various API : OneDrive ⏳, Google Drive ⏳, Google Maps ⏳, GitHub ⏳, Service Now ⏳, Jira ⏳, SalesForce ⏳... 

### Agents

The `core/agent/` directory serves as a baseline and example for developers eager to implement agents. An agent's architecture consists of three files and one directory:

1. **agent.py**: Manages the agent's creation, serving as an agent factory and overseeing basic actions (CRUD).
2. **loop.py**: Manages the loop logic.
3. **models.py**: Contains models required by your agent.
4. **strategies**: Holds `PromptStrategies`.
