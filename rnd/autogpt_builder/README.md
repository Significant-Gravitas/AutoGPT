This is the frontend for AutoGPT's next generation

## Getting Started

Run the following installation once.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

For subsequent runs, you do not have to `npm install` again. Simply do `npm run dev`.

If the project is updated via git, you will need to `npm install` after each update.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
