# AutoGPT Classic

AutoGPT Classic was an experimental project to demonstrate autonomous GPT-4 operation. It was designed to make GPT-4 independently operate and chain together tasks to achieve more complex goals.

## Project Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **This project is unsupported, and dependencies will not be updated. It was an experiment that has concluded its initial research phase. If you want to use AutoGPT, you should use the [AutoGPT Platform](/autogpt_platform)**

For those interested in autonomous AI agents, we recommend exploring more actively maintained alternatives or referring to this codebase for educational purposes only.

## Overview

AutoGPT Classic was one of the first implementations of autonomous AI agents - AI systems that can independently:
- Break down complex goals into smaller tasks
- Execute those tasks using available tools and APIs
- Learn from the results and adjust its approach
- Chain multiple actions together to achieve an objective

## Key Features

- üîÑ Autonomous task chaining
- üõ† Tool and API integration capabilities
- üíæ Memory management for context retention
- üîç Web browsing and information gathering
- üìù File operations and content creation
- üîÑ Self-prompting and task breakdown

## Structure

The project is organized into several key components:
- `/benchmark` - Performance testing tools
- `/forge` - Core autonomous agent framework
- `/frontend` - User interface components
- `/original_autogpt` - Original implementation

## Getting Started
