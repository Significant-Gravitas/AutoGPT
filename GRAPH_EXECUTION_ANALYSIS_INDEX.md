## Critical Findings

### IDENTIFIED BUG: Missing Cascading Stop

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `/blocks/agent.py:68` (AgentExecutorBlock.run method)  
**Issue:** When parent execution is terminated, child executions continue running

**Current Flow:**
```
User stops parent execution
    ↓
Parent execution loop breaks
    ↓
Parent status set to TERMINATED
    ↓
Child execution KEEPS RUNNING
    ↓
Child continues consuming credits
```

**Root Cause:**
- No explicit `parentGraphExecutionId` in database schema
- No way to discover child executions when parent terminates
- Parent-child relationships only tracked in runtime via event bus

**Impact:**
- Orphaned child executions running without supervision
- Uncontrolled credit consumption
- User unable to stop entire execution tree

**Fix Locations:**
1. Schema: Add `parentGraphExecutionId` field to AgentGraphExecution
2. Logic: Implement cascading stop in `stop_graph_execution()`
3. Propagation: Pass parent execution ID to child via AgentExecutorBlock.Input
4. Cleanup: Query and stop all child executions when parent stops

## Key Concepts Explained

### Execution Stopping Mechanism

**3-Step Process:**
1. **Signal Publication:** User calls REST endpoint → publish CancelExecutionEvent to RabbitMQ
2. **Event Detection:** Executor's cancel handler receives event → sets cancel_event flag
3. **Cleanup:** Execution loop detects flag → breaks loops → cancels tasks → updates database

**Timeouts:**
- QUEUED/INCOMPLETE: Force terminate immediately
- RUNNING: Poll with 100ms sleep, 15-second timeout
- Task cleanup: 3600-second timeout

### Sub-Agent Management

**Spawning:**
- AgentExecutorBlock.run() calls `add_graph_execution()`
- Creates independent GraphExecutionEntry
- Published to RabbitMQ as separate execution message
- No parent-child relationship persisted

**Tracking:**
- Parent subscribes to child via event_bus.listen()
- Waits for COMPLETED/TERMINATED/FAILED status
- No execution tree maintained
- Local reference lost if parent terminates

### State Transitions

**Queued Path:**
```
INCOMPLETE → QUEUED → [wait] → RUNNING → COMPLETED
                ↓
        if stop while QUEUED
                ↓
            TERMINATED
```

**Running Path:**
```
RUNNING → [cancel.is_set() check] → TERMINATED
   ↓ (3 detection points)
Cleanup
   ↓
Database updated
```

## RabbitMQ Architecture

**Two Separate Exchanges:**

1. **graph_execution** (DIRECT)
   - Type: Direct routing
   - Purpose: Distribute run tasks to workers
   - Queue: `graph_execution_queue`
   - Routing Key: `graph_execution.run`
   - Timeout: 86400s (1 day)

2. **graph_execution_cancel** (FANOUT)
   - Type: Fanout (broadcasts to all)
   - Purpose: Broadcast cancel to all executors
   - Queue: `graph_execution_cancel_queue`
   - Routing Key: (not used, FANOUT broadcasts to all)
   - Auto-delete: False (persistent)

## Execution State Machine

```
┌─────────────┐
│  INCOMPLETE │  (initial state, waiting for input)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   QUEUED    │  (in RabbitMQ queue)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   RUNNING   │  (actively executing)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ├──────────────────────┐
       │                      │
       ▼                      ▼
   ┌──────────┐        ┌─────────────┐
   │COMPLETED │        │  TERMINATED │  (if cancel.is_set())
   └──────────┘        └─────────────┘
   
Alternative:
RUNNING ──→ FAILED (if error occurs)
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Database Changes
- [ ] Add `parentGraphExecutionId` to AgentGraphExecution
- [ ] Create migration
- [ ] Update Prisma schema
- [ ] Regenerate Python client

### Phase 2: Context Propagation
- [ ] Add `parent_graph_exec_id` to GraphExecutionEntry
- [ ] Update AgentExecutorBlock.Input to accept parent ID
- [ ] Pass parent ID when creating child execution
- [ ] Store in database

### Phase 3: Cascading Stop
- [ ] Modify `stop_graph_execution()` to query children
- [ ] Publish stop for each child
- [ ] Wait for all children to terminate
- [ ] Handle nested/deep hierarchies

### Phase 4: Cost Management
- [ ] Track total cost of execution tree
- [ ] Implement cost cap per tree
- [ ] Add depth limiting
- [ ] Enforce via execution manager

### Phase 5: Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests with RabbitMQ
- [ ] Load testing with many children
- [ ] Edge case testing

## Known Limitations

1. **No Explicit Parent-Child Tracking**
   - Cannot query "all children of execution X"
   - Must scan all executions and filter

2. **No Cascading Stop**
   - Parent stop doesn't stop children
   - Children continue consuming credits

3. **No Execution Tree Limits**
   - No maximum nesting depth
   - No cost cap per tree

4. **Race Conditions**
   - Child can be created after parent stop
   - Child gets queued but parent terminated

5. **Event Bus Limitations**
   - Cannot filter by parent execution
   - No parent relationship in events

## Questions Answered

**Q: Where is the stop endpoint?**  
A: `/server/routers/v1.py:922` - `POST /graphs/{graph_id}/executions/{graph_exec_id}/stop`

**Q: How does the stop signal reach the executor?**  
A: RabbitMQ FANOUT exchange publishes `CancelExecutionEvent` to all listening workers

**Q: How does the executor respond to stop?**  
A: `_handle_cancel_message()` sets `cancel_event`, main loop polls it, breaks, and cleans up

**Q: Are child agents stopped when parent is stopped?**  
A: **NO** - This is the critical bug identified. Children continue running.

**Q: How are parent-child relationships tracked?**  
A: Currently only at runtime via event bus subscription. No database tracking exists.

**Q: What states can an execution be in?**  
A: INCOMPLETE, QUEUED, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, TERMINATED

**Q: How long does stop take?**  
A: QUEUED: immediate, RUNNING: up to 15 seconds by default

**Q: Can stop timeout?**  
A: Yes, raises TimeoutError if execution doesn't stop in wait_timeout seconds
