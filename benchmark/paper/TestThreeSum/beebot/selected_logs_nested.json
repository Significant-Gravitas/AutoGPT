The function should handle cases where the input array has multiple valid solutions by returning any one of them. The function should also handle cases where the input array has no valid solution by returning an empty list.\n\nTo accomplish this task, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new file called `sample_code.py`.\n2. Write the `three_sum` function in the `sample_code.py` file.\n3. Implement the logic to find three numbers that add up to the target.\n4. Test the function with different input arrays and targets to ensure it returns the correct indices.\n5.
