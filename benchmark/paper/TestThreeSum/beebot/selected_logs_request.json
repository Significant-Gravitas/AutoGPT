Follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Analyze the outcomes of past function executions, including the function used, the arguments used, and the results returned. Be alert to any repetitive function usage.\n2. Determine the next logical step towards the task goal, considering your current information, requirements, and available functions. Remember to be efficient, avoiding unnecessary steps like immediate verification of outcomes and repetitive function calls.\n3. Direct the execution of the next action using exactly one of the available functions. If the next action requires a tool that you do not have, instead instruct the AI Assistant to acquire it via `get_more_tools`.\n\nIf the AI Assistant appears to be making little progress and may be unable to proceed, instruct it to call the `rewind_actions` function to try another approach. If other approaches seem to have been unsuccessful, instruct the AI Assistant to call the `exit` function.\n\nOnce the original task has been completed, instruct the AI Assistant to call the `exit` function to indicate the completion of the task.\n\nPlease provide an analysis of the past history, followed by a concise summary of your plan going forward, and end with one sentence describing the next action to be taken."

This summary doesn't serve as a detailed step-by-step guide, but rather provides a comprehensive overview of the task's main objectives, key actions, participating entities, and the anticipated outcomes. The objective is to paint a clear picture that enables any AI Assistant to comprehend what needs to be achieved without ambiguity.\n\nNext, define the Exit Conditions in a separate paragraph with no title or heading. These are essentially the specific criteria or conditions that, once met, signal the successful completion of the task. To ensure the AI Assistant is able to correctly determine when the task is complete, clearly stipulate all required outcomes and establish concrete exit conditions.\n\nWhen defining the Exit Conditions, consider the efficiency and effectiveness of the AI Assistant. Exit Conditions should not imply the necessity for immediate verification of each step unless it's crucial for the task's success. Instead, indicate criteria that inherently demonstrate successful completion of the task. This will guide the AI Assistant in evaluating task progress and success without unnecessary redundancy.\n\nAs a human user has presented you with the following task: Create a three_sum function in a file called code.py.

The function should assume that each input has exactly one solution and that the same element cannot be used twice.

The `three_sum` function should take two parameters: an array of integers and a target integer.\n4. Inside the `three_sum` function, iterate over the array using three nested loops to find three numbers that add up to the target.\n5. If the sum of the three numbers is equal to the target, return the indices of the three numbers.\n6. Test the `three_sum` function with the provided example test case: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]` and `target = 20`.\n7. If the function returns the expected result, the task is complete. Otherwise, make necessary adjustments to the function and retest.\n\n# Next Action\nI will write the `code.py` file and define the `three_sum` function.\n\nFollow these guidelines:\n1. Study your high-level plan, and understand the next step in it.\n2. Implement the next action by using exactly one of the provided functions.\n3.

Avoid repetitive actions and unnecessary immediate verification of actions, especially when the outcomes are clear and confirmed by the previous functions. Trust the accuracy of past function executions, assuming the state of the system and files remain consistent with the historical outcomes.\n2. Regularly evaluate your progress towards the task goal. This includes checking the current state of the system against the task requirements and adjusting your strategy if necessary.\n3. If an error occurs (like 'File not found'), take a step back and analyze if it's an indicator of the next required action (like creating the file). Avoid getting stuck in loops by not repeating the action that caused the error without modifying the approach.\n4. Recognize when the task has been successfully completed according to the defined goal and exit conditions. Carefully interpret the instructions and conditions for task completion.\n5. Determine the next logical step towards the task goal, considering your current information, requirements, and available functions.\n6. Direct the execution of the immediate next action using exactly one of the available functions, making sure to skip any redundant actions that are already confirmed by the historical context.\n\nProvide, in paragraph format, an analysis of the past history, followed by a step-by-step summary of your plan going forward, and end with one sentence describing the immediate next action to be taken."

Initialize an empty dictionary called `num_dict` to store the indices of the numbers in the array.\n4. Iterate over the array and for each number, calculate the complement by subtracting it from the target value.\n5. Check if the complement exists in `num_dict`. If it does, return the indices of the current number, the complement, and the target value.\n6. If the complement does not exist in `num_dict`, add the current number and its index to `num_dict`.\n7.

Trust the accuracy of past function executions, assuming the state of the system and files remain consistent with the historical outcomes.\n2. Regularly evaluate your progress towards the task goal. This includes checking the current state of the system against the task requirements and adjusting your strategy if necessary.\n3. If an error occurs (like 'File not found'), take a step back and analyze if it's an indicator of the next required action (like creating the file). Avoid getting stuck in loops by not repeating the action that caused the error without modifying the approach.\n4. Recognize when the task has been successfully completed according to the defined goal and exit conditions. Carefully interpret the instructions and conditions for task completion.\n5. Determine the next logical step towards the task goal, considering your current information, requirements, and available functions.\n6. Direct the execution of the immediate next action using exactly one of the available functions, making sure to skip any redundant actions that are already confirmed by the historical context.\n\nProvide, in paragraph format, an analysis of the past history, followed by a step-by-step summary of your plan going forward, and end with one sentence describing the immediate next action to be taken."

This involves breaking down tasks into two distinct elements: a Goal Summary and Exit Conditions.\n\nThe Goal Summary should capture the essence of the task at hand in a concise paragraph with no title or heading. This summary doesn't serve as a detailed step-by-step guide, but rather provides a comprehensive overview of the task's main objectives, key actions, participating entities, and the anticipated outcomes. The objective is to paint a clear picture that enables any AI Assistant to comprehend what needs to be achieved without ambiguity.\n\nNext, define the Exit Conditions in a separate paragraph with no title or heading. These are essentially the specific criteria or conditions that, once met, signal the successful completion of the task. To ensure the AI Assistant is able to correctly determine when the task is complete, clearly stipulate all required outcomes and establish concrete exit conditions.\n\nWhen defining the Exit Conditions, consider the efficiency and effectiveness of the AI Assistant. Exit Conditions should not imply the necessity for immediate verification of each step unless it's crucial for the task's success. Instead, indicate criteria that inherently demonstrate successful completion of the task. This will guide the AI Assistant in evaluating task progress and success without unnecessary redundancy.\n\nAs a human user has presented you with the following task: Create a three_sum function in a file called sample_code.py. Given an array of integers, return indices of the three numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. Example: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 20, Because nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 7 + 11 = 20, return [0, 1, 2].\n\nYour objective is to translate this task into a Goal Summary and Exit Conditions, providing the AI Assistant with the necessary guidance to proceed effectively."

This involves breaking down tasks into two distinct elements: a Goal Summary and Exit Conditions.\n\nThe Goal Summary should capture the essence of the task at hand in a concise paragraph with no title or heading. This summary doesn't serve as a detailed step-by-step guide, but rather provides a comprehensive overview of the task's main objectives, key actions, participating entities, and the anticipated outcomes. The objective is to paint a clear picture that enables any AI Assistant to comprehend what needs to be achieved without ambiguity.\n\nNext, define the Exit Conditions in a separate paragraph with no title or heading. These are essentially the specific criteria or conditions that, once met, signal the successful completion of the task. To ensure the AI Assistant is able to correctly determine when the task is complete, clearly stipulate all required outcomes and establish concrete exit conditions.\n\nWhen defining the Exit Conditions, consider the efficiency and effectiveness of the AI Assistant. Exit Conditions should not imply the necessity for immediate verification of each step unless it's crucial for the task's success. Instead, indicate criteria that inherently demonstrate successful completion of the task. This will guide the AI Assistant in evaluating task progress and success without unnecessary redundancy.\n\nAs a human user has presented you with the following task: Create a three_sum function in a file called sample_code.py. Given an array of integers, return indices of the three numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. Example: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 20, Because nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 7 + 11 = 20, return [0, 1, 2].\n\nYour objective is to translate this task into a Goal Summary and Exit Conditions, providing the AI Assistant with the necessary guidance to proceed effectively."

The function should return the indices of three numbers in the array that add up to the target number. The function should assume that each input has exactly one solution and that the same element cannot be used twice.

If an error occurs (like 'File not found'), take a step back and analyze if it's an indicator of the next required action (like creating the file). Avoid getting stuck in loops by not repeating the action that caused the error without modifying the approach.\n4. Recognize when the task has been successfully completed according to the defined goal and exit conditions. Carefully interpret the instructions and conditions for task completion.\n5. Determine the next logical step towards the task goal, considering your current information, requirements, and available functions.\n6.

If other approaches seem to have been unsuccessful, instruct the AI Assistant to call the `exit` function with all arguments.\n\nOnce the original task has been completed, instruct the AI Assistant to call the `exit` function with all arguments to indicate the completion of the task.\n\n# Task\nYour original task, given by the human, is:\nGoal Summary:\nCreate a function called three_sum in a file called sample_code.py. The function should take an array of integers as input and return the indices of three numbers that add up to a specific target. The function should assume that each input has exactly one solution and that the same element cannot be used twice. For example, given the array [2, 7, 11, 15] and the target 20, the function should return [0, 1, 2] because nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 7 + 11 = 20.\n\nExit Conditions:\nThe task is complete when the three_sum function has been created in the sample_code.py file and returns the correct indices for the given input array and target. The function should correctly identify three numbers that add up to the target and return their indices in the form of a list. The function should handle cases where the input array has multiple valid solutions by returning any one of them. The function should also handle cases where the input array has no valid solution by returning an empty list.\n\n# History\nYou have a history of functions that the AI Assistant has already executed for this task. Here is the history, in order, starting with the first function executed:\n1. You executed the function `write_file` with the arguments {\"filename\": \"sample_code.py\"}: \"Error: Invalid arguments. Details: text_content: field required\".\n2. You executed the function `read_file` with the arguments {\"filename\": \"sample_code.py\"}: null.\n3. You executed the function `write_file` with the arguments {\"filename\": \"sample_code.py\"}: \"Error: Invalid arguments. Details: text_content: field required\".\n4. You executed the function `read_file` with the arguments {\"filename\": \"sample_code.py\"}: null.\n5. You executed the function `write_python_code` with the arguments {\"file_name\": \"sample_code.py\", \"code\": \"def three_sum(nums, target):\\n    for i in range(len(nums)-2):\\n        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)-1):\\n            for k in range(j+1, len(nums)):\\n                if nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == target:\\n                    return [i, j, k]\\n    return []\"}: \"Compiled successfully and saved to sample_code.py.\".\n\n# Files\nYou have read these files. Note that the contents of these files have been pre-read and are included directly in the prompt, therefore, you should not need to instruct the AI Assistant to read these files again:\n\n## Contents of file sample_code.py\ndef three_sum(nums, target):\n    for i in range(len(nums)-2):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)-1):\n            for k in range(j+1, len(nums)):\n                if nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == target:\n                    return [i, j, k]\n    return []\n\n# Instructions\nNow, devise a concise and adaptable plan to guide the AI Assistant. Follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Ensure you interpret the execution history correctly while considering the order of execution. Avoid repetitive actions and unnecessary immediate verification of actions, especially when the outcomes are clear and confirmed by the previous functions. Trust the accuracy of past function executions, assuming the state of the system and files remain consistent with the historical outcomes.\n2. Regularly evaluate your progress towards the task goal. This includes checking the current state of the system against the task requirements and adjusting your strategy if necessary.\n3. If an error occurs (like 'File not found'), take a step back and analyze if it's an indicator of the next required action (like creating the file). Avoid getting stuck in loops by not repeating the action that caused the error without modifying the approach.\n4. Recognize when the task has been successfully completed according to the defined goal and exit conditions. Carefully interpret the instructions and conditions for task completion.\n5. Determine the next logical step towards the task goal, considering your current information, requirements, and available functions.\n6. Direct the execution of the immediate next action using exactly one of the available functions, making sure to skip any redundant actions that are already confirmed by the historical context.\n\nProvide, in paragraph format, an analysis of the past history, followed by a step-by-step summary of your plan going forward, and end with one sentence describing the immediate next action to be taken."
