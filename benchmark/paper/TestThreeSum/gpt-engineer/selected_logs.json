The function will take two arguments: an array of integers and a target integer.\n3. If there are multiple valid solutions, the function will return any one of them.\n4.

            "content": "Based on the requirements, we will need one Python file named `sample_code.py` containing the function `three_sum`. This function will take two arguments: `nums` (a list of integers) and `target` (an integer), and it will return a list of three indices such that the corresponding numbers in `nums` add up to `target`.\n\nHere is the content of `sample_code.py`:\n\nsample_code.py\n```python\ndef three_sum(nums, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of integers, return indices of the three numbers such that they add up to a specific target.\n    Assumes that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.\n\n    :param nums: List of integers\n    :param target: Target integer\n    :return: List of three indices such that the corresponding numbers in nums add up to target\n    \"\"\"\n    num_to_index = {}\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        num_to_index[num] = i\n\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):\n            complement = target - nums[i] - nums[j]\n            if complement in num_to_index and num_to_index[complement] not in {i, j}:\n                return [i, j, num_to_index[complement]]\n\n    return []\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a dictionary that maps each number in `nums` to its index. Then it iterates over each pair of numbers in `nums`, calculates the complement of the pair with respect to `target`, and checks if this complement is in the dictionary. If it is, and its index is different from the indices of the pair, it returns the indices of the pair and the complement. If no such triple is found, it returns an empty list.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. If these assumptions do not hold, the function may not work correctly."
