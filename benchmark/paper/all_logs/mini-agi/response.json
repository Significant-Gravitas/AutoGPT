I then ingested revenue data from https://www.statista.com/statistics/272120/revenue-of-tesla/. Tesla's revenue in 2022 grew to nearly $81.5 billion, a 51% increase from the previous year. The United States is Tesla's largest sales market, and over $71 billion of their revenue comes from the automotive segment. The Model Y is their best-selling vehicle, and the Model 3 reached one million global sales. Tesla has focused its spending on the production of the Model 3 and Model Y. They purchased land in Shanghai to build a Gigafactory for production in China. Tesla's Scope 3 emissions, waste diversion, and freshwater withdrawal for manufacturing were reported. Competitors' plug-in electric vehicle sales and market share were discussed, along with revenue and vehicle sales of BYD Group, Volkswagen AG, and General Motors. The sales of Chevy Bolt EV in the United States and Tesla's U.S. market share were highlighted. Additional statistics on Tesla's car sales in Finland, number of Tesla cars registered in Spain, Tesla's employees, battery costs, media perception, and social media audience were included."

This seems to be a mistake as \"import\" is a keyword in Python and cannot be used as a module name. The correct way to import a module in Python is \"import module_name\" or \"from module_name import something\".
