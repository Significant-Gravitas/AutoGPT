The password should be printed to the console. The entry point will be a python file that can be run this way: python password_generator.py [--len x] where x is the length of the password. If no length is specified, the password should be 8 characters long. The password_generator can also be imported as a module and called as password = password_generator.generate_password(len=x). Any invalid input should raise a ValueError."
