# AutoGPT: An Autonomous GPT-4 Experiment

[üìñ **Documentation**][docs]
&ensp;|&ensp;
[üöÄ **Contributing**](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

AutoGPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of modern Large Language Models. This program, driven by GPT-4, chains together LLM "thoughts", to autonomously achieve whatever goal you set. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, AutoGPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.

## Setting up AutoGPT
1. Get an OpenAI [API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
2. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and set `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Make sure you have Poetry [installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

For more ways to run AutoGPT, more detailed instructions, and more configuration options,
see the [setup guide][docs/setup].

## Running AutoGPT
The CLI should be self-documenting:
```shell
$ ./autogpt.sh --help
Usage: python -m autogpt [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  run    Sets up and runs an agent, based on the task specified by the...
  serve  Starts an Agent Protocol compliant AutoGPT server, which creates...
```
When run without a sub-command, it will default to `run` for legacy reasons.

<details>
<summary>
<code>$ ./autogpt.sh run --help</code>
</summary>

The `run` sub-command starts AutoGPT with the legacy CLI interface:

```shell
$ ./autogpt.sh run --help
Usage: python -m autogpt run [OPTIONS]

  Sets up and runs an agent, based on the task specified by the user, or
  resumes an existing agent.

Options:
  -c, --continuous                Enable Continuous Mode
  -y, --skip-reprompt             Skips the re-prompting messages at the
                                  beginning of the script
  -C, --ai-settings FILE          Specifies which ai_settings.yaml file to
                                  use, relative to the AutoGPT root directory.
                                  Will also automatically skip the re-prompt.
  -P, --prompt-settings FILE      Specifies which prompt_settings.yaml file to
                                  use.

  --override-directives           If specified, --constraint, --resource and
                                  --best-practice will override the AI's
                                  directives instead of being appended to them
  --help                          Show this message and exit.

  agent for every task.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

This experiment aims to showcase the potential of GPT-4 but comes with some limitations:

1. Not a polished application or product, just an experiment
2. May not perform well in complex, real-world business scenarios. In fact, if it actually does, please share your results!
3. Quite expensive to run, so set and monitor your API key limits with OpenAI!
