# v0.4.7 RELEASE HIGHLIGHTS! ðŸš€
# -----------------------------
This release introduces initial REST API support, powered by e2b's agent 
protocol SDK (https://github.com/e2b-dev/agent-protocol#sdk). 

It also includes improvements to prompt generation and support 
for our new benchmarking tool, Auto-GPT-Benchmarks
(https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Benchmarks).

We've also moved our documentation to Material Theme, at https://docs.agpt.co.

As usual, we've squashed a few bugs and made some under-the-hood improvements.
