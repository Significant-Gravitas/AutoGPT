Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

FILE_FORMAT

You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, finish by writing "this concludes a fully working implementation".
