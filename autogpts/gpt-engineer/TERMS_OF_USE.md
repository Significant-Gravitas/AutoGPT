# Terms of Use

Welcome to gpt-engineer! By utilizing this powerful tool, you acknowledge and agree to the following comprehensive Terms of Use. We also encourage you to review the linked [disclaimer of warranty](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/blob/main/DISCLAIMER.md) for additional information.

Both OpenAI, L.L.C. and the dedicated creators behind the remarkable gpt-engineer have implemented a data collection process focused on enhancing the product's capabilities. This endeavor is undertaken with utmost care and dedication to safeguarding user privacy. Rest assured that no information that could be directly attributed to any individual is stored.

It's important to be aware that the utilization of natural text inputs, including the 'prompt' and 'feedback' files, may be subject to storage. While it's theoretically possible to establish connections between a person's writing style or content within these files and their real-life identity, please note that the creators of gpt-engineer explicitly assure that such attempts will never be made.

For a deeper understanding of OpenAI's overarching terms of use, we encourage you to explore the details available [here](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use).

Should you desire to curtail the collection of usage data by gpt-engineer itself (but not by OpenAI), you have the option to exercise control by setting the environment variable COLLECT_LEARNINGS_OPT_OUT=true.

Your engagement with gpt-engineer is an acknowledgment and acceptance of these terms, demonstrating your commitment to using this tool responsibly and within the bounds of ethical conduct. We appreciate your trust and look forward to the exciting possibilities that gpt-engineer can offer in your endeavors.
