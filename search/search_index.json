We appreciate your time and effort, and we value any contribution, whether it's reporting a bug, suggesting a new feature, or submitting a pull request. This document provides guidelines and best practices to help you contribute effectively. Code of Conduct By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct . Please read it to understand the expectations we have for everyone who contributes to this project. \ud83d\udce2 A Quick Word Right now we will not be accepting any Contributions that add non-essential commands to Auto-GPT. However, you absolutely can still add these commands to Auto-GPT in the form of plugins. Please check out this template . Getting Started Fork the repository and clone your fork. Create a new branch for your changes (use a descriptive name, such as fix-bug-123 or add-new-feature ). Make your changes in the new branch. Test your changes thoroughly. Commit and push your changes to your fork. Create a pull request following the guidelines in the Submitting Pull Requests section. How to Contribute Reporting Bugs If you find a bug in the project, please create an issue on GitHub with the following information: A clear, descriptive title for the issue. A description of the problem, including steps to reproduce the issue. Any relevant logs, screenshots, or other supporting information. Suggesting Enhancements If you have an idea for a new feature or improvement, please create an issue on GitHub with the following information: A clear, descriptive title for the issue. A detailed description of the proposed enhancement, including any benefits and potential drawbacks. Any relevant examples, mockups, or supporting information. Submitting Pull Requests When submitting a pull request, please ensure that your changes meet the following criteria: Your pull request should be atomic and focus on a single change. Your pull request should include tests for your change. We automatically enforce this with CodeCov You should have thoroughly tested your changes with multiple different prompts. You should have considered potential risks and mitigations for your changes. You should have documented your changes clearly and comprehensively. You should not include any unrelated or \"extra\" small tweaks or changes. Style Guidelines Code Formatting We use the black and isort code formatters to maintain a consistent coding style across the project. Please ensure that your code is formatted properly before submitting a pull request. To format your code, run the following commands in the project's root directory: python -m black . python -m isort . Or if you have these tools installed globally: black . isort . Pre-Commit Hooks We use pre-commit hooks to ensure that code formatting and other checks are performed automatically before each commit. To set up pre-commit hooks for this project, follow these steps: Install the pre-commit package using pip: pip install pre-commit Run the following command in the project's root directory to install the pre-commit hooks: pre-commit install Now, the pre-commit hooks will run automatically before each commit, checking your code formatting and other requirements. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out to the maintainers or open a new issue on GitHub. We're here to help and appreciate your efforts to contribute to the project. Happy coding, and once again, thank you for your contributions! Maintainers will look at PR that have no merge conflicts when deciding what to add to the project. Make sure your PR shows up here: https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+-label%3Aconflicts Testing your changes If you add or change code, make sure the updated code is covered by tests. To increase coverage if necessary, [write tests using pytest ]. For more info on running tests, please refer to \"Running tests\" . In Pytest, we use VCRpy. It's a package that allows us to save OpenAI and other API providers' responses. When you run Pytest locally: If no prompt change: you will not consume API tokens because there are no new OpenAI calls required. If the prompt changes in a way that the cassettes are not reusable: If no API key, the test fails. It requires a new cassette. So, add an API key to .env. If the API key is present, the tests will make a real call to OpenAI. If the test ends up being successful, your prompt changes didn't introduce regressions. This is good. Commit your cassettes to your PR. If the test is unsuccessful: Either: Your change made Auto-GPT less capable, in that case, you have to change your code. Or: The test might be poorly written. In that case, you can make suggestions to change the test. In our CI pipeline, Pytest will use the cassettes and not call paid API providers, so we need your help to record the replays that you break.","title":"Contribution guide"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing-to-auto-gpt","text":"First of all, thank you for considering contributing to our project!

Attention To use the OpenAI API with Auto-GPT, we strongly recommend setting up billing (AKA paid account). Free accounts are limited to 3 API calls per minute, which can cause the application to crash. You can set up a paid account at Manage account > Billing > Overview . Important It's highly recommended that you keep keep track of your API costs on the Usage page . You can also set limits on how much you spend on the Usage limits page . Setting up Auto-GPT Set up with Docker Make sure you have Docker installed, see requirements Pull the latest image from Docker Hub docker pull significantgravitas/auto-gpt Create a folder for Auto-GPT In the folder, create a file called docker-compose.yml with the following contents: version : \"3.9\" services : auto-gpt : image : significantgravitas/auto-gpt depends_on : - redis env_file : - .env environment : MEMORY_BACKEND : ${MEMORY_BACKEND:-redis} REDIS_HOST : ${REDIS_HOST:-redis} volumes : - ./:/app profiles : [ \"exclude-from-up\" ] redis : image : \"redis/redis-stack-server:latest\" Create the necessary configuration files. If needed, you can find templates in the repository . Continue to Run with Docker Set up with Git Important Make sure you have Git installed for your OS. Info To execute the given commands, open a CMD, Bash, or Powershell window. On Windows: press Win + X and pick Terminal , or Win + R and enter cmd Clone the repository git clone -b stable https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT.git Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the repository cd Auto-GPT Set up without Git/Docker Warning We recommend to use Git or Docker, to make updating easier. Download Source code (zip) from the latest stable release Extract the zip-file into a folder Configuration Find the file named .env.template in the main Auto-GPT folder. This file may be hidden by default in some operating systems due to the dot prefix. To reveal hidden files, follow the instructions for your specific operating system: Windows , macOS . Create a copy of .env.template and call it .env ; if you're already in a command prompt/terminal window: cp .env.template .env . Open the .env file in a text editor. Find the line that says OPENAI_API_KEY= . After the = , enter your unique OpenAI API Key without any quotes or spaces . Enter any other API keys or tokens for services you would like to use. Note To activate and adjust a setting, remove the # prefix. Save and close the .env file. Info Get your ElevenLabs API key from: ElevenLabs . You can view your xi-api-key using the \"Profile\" tab on the website. Using a GPT Azure-instance If you want to use GPT on an Azure instance, set USE_AZURE to True and make an Azure configuration file: Rename azure.yaml.template to azure.yaml and provide the relevant azure_api_base , azure_api_version and all the deployment IDs for the relevant models in the azure_model_map section: fast_llm_model_deployment_id : your gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 deployment ID smart_llm_model_deployment_id : your gpt-4 deployment ID embedding_model_deployment_id : your text-embedding-ada-002 v2 deployment ID Example: # Please specify all of these values as double-quoted strings # Replace string in angled brackets (<>) to your own ID azure_model_map : fast_llm_model_deployment_id : \"<my-fast-llm-deployment-id>\" ...

Defaults to autogpt . Weaviate Setup Weaviate is an open-source vector database. It allows to store data objects and vector embeddings from ML-models and scales seamlessly to billion of data objects. To set up a Weaviate database, check out their Quickstart Tutorial . Although still experimental, Embedded Weaviate is supported which allows the Auto-GPT process itself to start a Weaviate instance. To enable it, set USE_WEAVIATE_EMBEDDED to True and make sure you pip install \"weaviate-client>=3.15.4\" . Install the Weaviate client Install the Weaviate client before usage. $ pip install weaviate-client Setting up environment variables In your .env file set the following: MEMORY_BACKEND = weaviate WEAVIATE_HOST = \"127.0.0.1\" # the IP or domain of the running Weaviate instance WEAVIATE_PORT = \"8080\" WEAVIATE_PROTOCOL = \"http\" WEAVIATE_USERNAME = \"your username\" WEAVIATE_PASSWORD = \"your password\" WEAVIATE_API_KEY = \"your weaviate API key if you have one\" WEAVIATE_EMBEDDED_PATH = \"/home/me/.local/share/weaviate\" # this is optional and indicates where the data should be persisted when running an embedded instance USE_WEAVIATE_EMBEDDED = False # set to True to run Embedded Weaviate MEMORY_INDEX = \"Autogpt\" # name of the index to create for the application View Memory Usage View memory usage by using the --debug flag :) \ud83e\udde0 Memory pre-seeding Memory pre-seeding allows you to ingest files into memory and pre-seed it before running Auto-GPT. $ python data_ingestion.py -h usage: data_ingestion.py [ -h ] ( --file FILE | --dir DIR ) [ --init ] [ --overlap OVERLAP ] [ --max_length MAX_LENGTH ] Ingest a file or a directory with multiple files into memory.

Note that you can also use the --file argument to ingest a single file into memory and that data_ingestion.py will only ingest files within the /auto_gpt_workspace directory. The DIR path is relative to the auto_gpt_workspace directory, so python data_ingestion.py --dir . --init will ingest everything in auto_gpt_workspace directory. You can adjust the max_length and overlap parameters to fine-tune the way the documents are presented to the AI when it \"recall\" that memory: Adjusting the overlap value allows the AI to access more contextual information from each chunk when recalling information, but will result in more chunks being created and therefore increase memory backend usage and OpenAI API requests. Reducing the max_length value will create more chunks, which can save prompt tokens by allowing for more message history in the context, but will also increase the number of chunks. Increasing the max_length value will provide the AI with more contextual information from each chunk, reducing the number of chunks created and saving on OpenAI API requests. However, this may also use more prompt tokens and decrease the overall context available to the AI. Memory pre-seeding is a technique for improving AI accuracy by ingesting relevant data into its memory. Chunks of data are split and added to memory, allowing the AI to access them quickly and generate more accurate responses. It's useful for large datasets or when specific information needs to be accessed quickly. Examples include ingesting API or GitHub documentation before running Auto-GPT. Attention If you use Redis for memory, make sure to run Auto-GPT with WIPE_REDIS_ON_START=False For other memory backends, we currently forcefully wipe the memory when starting Auto-GPT. To ingest data with those memory backends, you can call the data_ingestion.py script anytime during an Auto-GPT run.
