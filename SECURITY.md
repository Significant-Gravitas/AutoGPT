# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

We take the security of our project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us privately. **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

> **Important Note**: Any code within the `classic/` folder is considered legacy, unsupported, and out of scope for security reports. We will not address security vulnerabilities in this deprecated code.

Instead, please report them via:
- [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/security/advisories/new)
- [Huntr.dev](https://huntr.com/repos/significant-gravitas/autogpt) - where you may be eligible for a bounty

### Reporting Process
1. **Submit Report**: Use one of the above channels to submit your report
2. **Response Time**: Our team will acknowledge receipt of your report within 14 business days.
3. **Collaboration**: We will collaborate with you to understand and validate the issue
4. **Resolution**: We will work on a fix and coordinate the release process

### Disclosure Policy
- Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps
- Include the version/commit hash where you discovered the vulnerability
- Allow us a 90-day security fix window before any public disclosure
- Share any potential mitigations or workarounds if known

| Version | Supported |
