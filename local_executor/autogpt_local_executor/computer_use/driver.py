"""Runs cua-driver for the shim.

One `cua-driver mcp` process serves every session of a shim process. It
starts on first use, restarts after it stops (within a limit), and stops
with the shim. The shim launches it with a YAML permission policy that
allows only the catalog's tools, in cua-driver's `standard` permission mode,
with its telemetry and update checks off. See docs/CUA_DRIVER.md.
