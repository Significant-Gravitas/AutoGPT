      in Greek, without any intention of publication, by the only Roman emperor who
      was also a philosopher, the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius (AD 121-180) offer
      a remarkable series of challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed
      as the emperor struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe.
      Ranging from doubt and despair to conviction and exaltation, they cover such
      diverse topics as the nature of moral virtue, human rationality, divine providence,
      and Marcus'' own emotions. But while the Meditations were composed to provide
      personal consolation and encouragement, in developing his beliefs Marcus Aurelius
      also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a timeless collection
      of extended meditations and short aphorisms that has been consulted and admired
      by statesmen, thinkers and readers through the centuries. ...more Product Information

      Ranging from doubt and despair to conviction and ex Written in Greek, without
      any intention of publication, by the only Roman emperor who was also a philosopher,
      the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius (AD 121-180) offer a remarkable series of
      challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the emperor struggled
      to understand himself and make sense of the universe. Ranging from doubt and
      despair to conviction and exaltation, they cover such diverse topics as the
      nature of moral virtue, human rationality, divine providence, and Marcus'' own
      emotions. But while the Meditations were composed to provide personal consolation
      and encouragement, in developing his beliefs Marcus Aurelius also created one
      of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a timeless collection of extended
      meditations and short aphorisms that has been consulted and admired by statesmen,
      thinkers and readers through the centuries. ...more Product Information UPC4f19709e47883df5
