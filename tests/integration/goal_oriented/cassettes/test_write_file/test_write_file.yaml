      ''Hello World'' into a file named \"hello_world.txt\" and then use the task_complete
      command to complete the task.\nYour decisions must always be made independently
      without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue
      simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\nGOALS:\n\n1. Use the write_to_file
      command to write ''Hello World'' into a file named \"hello_world.txt\".\n2.
      Use the task_complete command to complete the task.\n3. Do not use any other
      commands.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your
      short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.\n2.
      If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events,
      thinking about similar events will help you remember.\n3. No user assistance\n4.
      Exclusively use the commands listed in double quotes e.g. \"command name\"\n\nCommands:\n1.

      Internet access for searches and information gathering.\n2. Long Term memory
      management.\n3. GPT-3.5 powered Agents for delegation of simple tasks.\n4. File
