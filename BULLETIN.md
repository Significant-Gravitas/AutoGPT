# For contributors 👷🏼
Since releasing v0.3.0, we are working on re-architecting the Auto-GPT core to make
it more extensible and to make room for structural performance-oriented R&D.
In the meantime, we have less time to process incoming pull requests and issues,
so we focus on high-value contributions:
 * significant bugfixes
 * *major* improvements to existing functionality and/or docs (so no single-typo fixes)
 * contributions that help us with re-architecture and other roadmapped items
We have to be somewhat selective in order to keep making progress, but this does not
mean you can't contribute. Check out the contribution guide on our wiki:
