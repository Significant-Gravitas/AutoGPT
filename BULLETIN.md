# v0.4.4 RELEASE HIGHLIGHTS! ðŸš€
# -----------------------------
## GPT-4 is back!
Following OpenAI's recent GPT-4 GA announcement, the SMART_LLM .env setting 
now defaults to GPT-4, and Auto-GPT will use GPT-4 by default in its main loop.

### !! High Costs Warning !! ðŸ’°ðŸ’€ðŸš¨
GPT-4 costs ~20x more than GPT-3.5-turbo. 
Please take note of this before using SMART_LLM. You can use `--gpt3only` 
or `--gpt4only` to force the use of GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4, respectively, 
at runtime.

## Re-arch v1 preview release!
We've released a preview version of the re-arch code, under `autogpt/core`. 
This is a major milestone for us, and we're excited to continue working on it. 
We look forward to your feedback. Follow the process here:
