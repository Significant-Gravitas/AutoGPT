# 🚀 v0.4.3 Release 🚀
We're happy to announce the 0.4.3 maintenance release, which primarily focuses on refining the LLM command execution,
extending support for OpenAI's latest models (including the powerful GPT-3 16k model), and laying the groundwork 
for future compatibility with OpenAI's function calling feature.

Key Highlights:
- OpenAI API Key Prompt: Auto-GPT will now courteously prompt users for their OpenAI API key, if it's not already provided.
- Summarization Enhancements: We've optimized Auto-GPT's use of the LLM context window even further.
- JSON Memory Reading: Support for reading memories from JSON files has been improved, resulting in enhanced task execution.
- Deprecated commands, removed for a leaner, more performant LLM: analyze_code, write_tests, improve_code, audio_text, web_playwright, web_requests
